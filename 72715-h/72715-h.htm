<span class="allsmcap">TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.</span>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> this is the pillar that Rob Roy hid
behind, the Sabbath day that he warned
the young English gentleman in the kirk.
It’s the very place itsel. Here was the
pulpit—and the seats were a’ here, and
this is the pillar that hid Rob Roy.”</p>

<p>A party of young men were in the crypt
of Glasgow cathedral—the little sleek,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
humble-looking man, who very unobtrusively
acted as Cicerone, was pointing out
to them the notability, with these words.</p>

<p>One of the visitors turned away with a
grave smile, and leaving his companions,
began to wander slowly down one of the
long black aisles. The dim withdrawing
vistas—the pillars with their floral chaplets—the
singular grace and majesty of
those dark and ponderous arches—impressed
him with very different associations.
The young man’s smile, slightly
scornful at first, melted as he reached the
lower end, and looking up through this
grand avenue, saw the little knot of dim
figures in the distance. He was glad to
escape from their laughter, and unsuitable
merriment. These noble old cloisters
were too grave and solemn, to have their
stillness so invaded.</p>

<p>But he was not suffered long to remain
uninterrupted in his contemplative mood.
“What ails Cuthbert?” said one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
younger of the party, a lad in the transition
state between boy and man. “See
to him down yonder at the very end, like
a craw in the mist—I say, Cuthbert!”</p>

<p>As the piping shrill voice called out
his name at its highest pitch, the young
man began slowly to advance again. The
lad came forward to meet him. “What
are you smiling at—what did you go away
for?”</p>

<p>“I was smiling at myself, John,” answered
the accused.</p>

<p>John was curious. “What for?”</p>

<p>“For thinking there were things more
interesting here, than the pillar that hid
Rob Roy. Come along—never mind.
Where are they all bound for, now?”</p>

<p>They were bound for a very dissimilar
place—no other than the crowded Broomielaw,
where John’s brothers were bent upon
showing their Edinburgh cousin, Cuthbert
Charteris, and an English stranger
who accompanied them, one or two fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
ships belonging to “the house” then in
port. These young men were the sons of
a prosperous merchant, all of them already
in harness in the office, and beginning to
make private ventures on their own behalf.
There were three of them—Richard, Alick,
and John Buchanan; the two elder had
reached the full dignity of young manhood,
and rejoiced in mighty whiskers,
which John, poor fellow, could only covet
intensely, and cultivate with all his might;
but even John had begun to have the
shrewd man of business engrafted on the
boy, and was sometimes precociously calculating,
and commercial—sometimes disagreeably
swaggering and loud—though
not unfrequently simple, foolish, and generous,
as better became his years.</p>

<p>“I say, Cuthbert,” said the communicative
John, as he swung his arm through
his grave cousin’s, and followed his gay
brothers on the way to the river, “did
you ever see Harry Muir? Dick says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
he’s going to make him come and dine
with us to-night.”</p>

<p>“And who is Harry Muir?” asked
Charteris.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s nobody—only a clerk in the
office you know—but you never saw such
a clever chap. He can sing anything you
like. He’s a grand singer. And when
Harry’s in a good humour, you should
just hear him with the fellows in the
office. My father looks out of his own room
sometimes to see what’s the row, and
there’s Gilchrist sucking his pen, and
Macauley and Alick close down over their
books, writing for a race, and Muir quite
cool, and looking as innocent as can
be. You should just see them, and see
how puzzled my father is, when he finds
that there’s no row at all!”</p>

<p>“And in such emergencies, how do you
behave yourself, Johnnie?”</p>

<p>“Johnnie! I wish you’d just mind
that I’m not a boy now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p>“Jack, then! Will that please you,
young man,” said Charteris, smiling.</p>

<p>“Me? I behave the best way I can,”
said the mollified John. “The best plan
is, to set to working, and never let on that
you hear the door open; but we like to
get him among a lot of us when there’s
nobody in the way; and you’ll just see
to-night, Cuthbert, what a grand fellow
he is for fun.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert did not look very much delighted.
“And when is this famous dinner
to be?” he asked. “Is Dick to
entertain us at home?”</p>

<p>Master John burst into a great laugh.
“Man, Cuthbert, what a simple fellow
you are! You don’t think my mother
would ask Harry Muir to dine.”</p>

<p>“And why not, my boy?” asked the
Edinburgh advocate.</p>

<p>“Why not! Man, is that the way you
do in the east country? He’s only a
clerk, and everybody knows you Edinburgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
folk are as proud as proud can be.
Would you ask your clerk to dine with
you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t possess such an appendage,
Sir John,” said the briefless barrister,
“except it be a little scrubby boy like
what you were the last time I was west
here—and he certainly would need some
brushing up. So he’s not a gentleman,
this wit of yours? He would not be
presentable in the drawing-room?”</p>

<p>“Hum! I don’t know,” said honest
John, hesitating. “He looks quite as
well as Dick or Alick, or that Liverpool
man there.” The lad drew himself up
and arranged his neckcloth complacently.
“There’s handsomer men, to be sure; but
I think Muir’s better looking than any of
you, Cuthbert.”</p>

<p>Charteris laughed: “Is he not well-bred,
then?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he can behave himself well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
enough. He’s got a way of his own, you
know; but then he’s a clerk.”</p>

<p>“And so are you, Jack, my man,” said
Charteris.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, but there’s a difference. He’s
got no money—and more than that,” said
the juvenile merchant, “he’s got no enterprise,
Cuthbert. There’s Alick, he had a
share in a plan, sending out a lot of things
to San Francisco on a venture, just when
the news came about the gold, you know,
and he cleared a hundred pounds; that’s
the way to do. But then, that fellow
Muir, he never tries a thing; and worse
than that, he went away and married
somebody last year, and he had three sisters
before, and them all living with him.
Just think of that. Four women all
dragging a young man down when he
might be rising in the world. Isn’t it
awful?”</p>

<p>“A very serious burden,” said Charteris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
smiling, “but what is his salary,
John?”</p>

<p>“His salary’s sixty pounds; my father
gives very good salaries. He’s just a
clerk, you know. The cashier has two
hundred.”</p>

<p>“Sixty pounds! and five people live on
sixty pounds!” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>“And they’ve got a baby,” said John,
solemnly.</p>

<p>It was the climax; there was no more
said.</p>

<p>The respectable firm of George Buchanan
and Sons had its office in a dingy business
street near the Exchange. The early darkness
of the February night had almost
blotted out the high sombre houses opposite,
except for the gleaming gas-light
streaming from office windows in irregular
patches from garret to basement. It was
not a very busy time, and at five o’clock
the clerks were preparing to leave the
office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>“I say, Muir,” cried Richard Buchanan,
bursting in hastily, “come and dine with
us.”</p>

<p>Charteris was behind. The famous
Harry Muir was certainly handsome—very
much better looking than any other
of the party, and had a fine, sparkling,
joyous, intelligent face—but the lines of it
had everything in them but firmness.</p>

<p>“Not to-night,” said the clerk, “you
must not ask me to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why not to-night?” said the young
master. “Come along now, Harry. Do
be a good fellow. Why it’s just to-night
of all nights that we want you. There’s
my cousin Charteris, and there’s an
Englishman; and we’re all as flat as the
Clyde. Come along, Muir, don’t disoblige
us.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” said Muir, “but I
can’t stay in town to-night. Let me off
to-night; I will be more obedient next
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>“He wants to get home to nurse his
wife,” said Buchanan, with a sneer.</p>

<p>“My wife is quite well,” answered
Harry, with a quick flush of anger; “she
does not need my nursing, Mr. Buchanan.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mr.</i> Buchanan! don’t be ill-natured,
Harry—come along.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I cannot go to-night. I
don’t think I can stay to-night,” said the
brilliant facile clerk.</p>

<p>The entreaties continued a little longer;
the resistance became feebler and more
feeble, and at last, stipulating that he was
to leave them early, the genius of the
counting-house consented.</p>

<p>“Harry, my man, send a message to
your wife,” said a grave snuffy person,
who enjoyed the two hundred pounds a
year of which John had boasted, and was
cashier to the Messrs. Buchanan.</p>

<p>Harry wavered a moment. “Where is
the boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps she’ll come for you, Harry,”
suggested the malicious Buchanan.</p>

<p>The poor clerk threw down, angrily,
the pen he had taken up, and lifted his
hat. In another minute, with quickly recovered
gaiety, they went out in a band
to the adjacent square where they were
to dine.</p>

<p>“There’s the makings of a capital man
in that lad, and there’s the makings of a
blackguard,” said the grave Mr. Gilchrist,
shaking his head ruefully, and taking a
pinch of snuff; “it’ll be a hard race—which
of them will win?”</p>

<p>The dinner in George’s-square went off
very well, and the young clerk, as he
warmed, dazzled the little company; he
was only a clerk—they were inclined to
patronize him at other times—but now the
unmistakeable, undesired, pre-eminence,
which these young men yielded to their
poor companion, was a noticeable thing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
The matter of ambition now, was, who
should seem most intimate with—who
should most attract the attention of the
brilliant clerk.</p>

<p>Cuthbert Charteris was a more completely
educated man than any other of
the party. The thorough literary training
will not ally itself to the commercial, as it
seems. None of the young merchants
had time for the long discipline and
athletic mental exercises of the student.
They were all making money before they
should have been well emancipated from
the school-room—all independent men,
when they should have been boys—and
the contrast was marked enough. There
was a good deal of boisterousness in their
enjoyment, and they were enjoying themselves
heartily, while Cuthbert, getting
very weary, felt himself only preserved
from utter impatience of their mirth by
the interest with which the stranger inspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
him—this poor, clever, facile Harry
Muir.</p>

<p>The quick mind of this young man
seemed to have attained somehow to the
results of education without the training
and discipline which form so principal a
part of it. He seemed to have been a
desultory reader, a devourer of everything
which came in his way, and while the
Buchanans knew few books beyond the
serial literature of the time, Harry threw
delicate allusions about him, which it
seemed he made only for his own enjoyment,
since the arrows flew most innocently
over the heads of all the rest.
Threads of connection with those great
thoughts which form the common country
of imaginative minds, ideas radiating
out from the centre of these, like the
lessening circles in the water—the student
Cuthbert heard and understood, and wondered—the
Buchanans applauded, and did
not understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p>One of them at last proposed to go to
the theatre—the rest chimed in eagerly.
Cuthbert, anxious to have the evening
concluded as soon as possible, and resolving
to seek no more of the delectable
society of his young cousins except at
home, where they were tolerable, remonstrated
only to be laughed at and overpowered.
The grown-up, mature, educated
man resigned himself to their
boyish guidance very wearily—and what
would their wit do now?</p>

<p>He said he would go home—he took
up his hat, and played hesitatingly with
his gloves. He was excited with the
company, the applause, and a little with
the wine, and was permitting himself to
parley with the tempter.</p>

<p>“Come along, Muir, it’s only for once;
let us just have this one night.”</p>

<p>“No, no.” The noes grew faint; the
hesitation increased. He consented again.</p>

<p>And so, louder and more boisterous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
than before, they again entered the busy
streets. John Buchanan was a good deal
inclined to be obstreperous. It was all
that Cuthbert could manage to keep him
within bounds.</p>

<p>They had reached the Trongate, and
Cuthbert stopped his young companion a
moment to look down the long gleaming
line of the crowded street. It had been
wet in the morning, and the brilliant light
from the shop windows glistened in the
wet causeway in long lines, and the shifting
groups of passengers went and came,
ceaselessly, and the hum and din of the
great thoroughfare was softened by the
gloom and brightened by the light of
traffic that illuminated all.</p>

<p>“What are you looking at? See
they’re all away across the street. What’s
the good of glowering down the Trongate?
Man, Cuthbert, how slow you
are,” said John Buchanan, dragging the
loiterer on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p>There was a crowd on the opposite side
which had absorbed the others. Cuthbert
and John crossed over.</p>

<p>The accident which attracted the crowd
was a very common one—an overtasked
horse, wearied with the long day’s labour,
had stumbled and fallen; and now, the
weight of the cart to which it was attached
having been removed, was making convulsive
plunges in the effort to rise. The
carters, and the kindred class who are
always to be found ready in such small
emergencies, were leaping aside themselves,
and pressing back the lookers on,
as the poor animal struck out his great
weary limbs, endeavouring to raise himself
from the ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a shrill cry—“The
wean—look at the wean; the brute’s fit’ll
kill the wean.”</p>

<p>John Buchanan had pushed his way
into the crowd, dragging with him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
reluctant Cuthbert—and there indeed, close
to the great hoofs of the prostrate animal,
stood one of those little pale, careworn,
withered children whom one sees only in
the streets of great cities, and oftenest
only at this unwholesome hour of night.
But the acuteness peculiar to the class
seemed to have forsaken the very little
wrinkled old man of the Trongate. He
was standing where the next plunge would
inevitably throw him down, with the
strange scared look which is not fear,
common to children in great peril, upon
his small white puckered face. Again the
panting horse threw out his hoofs in
another convulsive exertion. The child
was down.</p>

<p>A shadow shot across the light. There
were several cries of women. The child
was thrown into somebody’s arms uninjured.
The horse was on its feet, and a
man, indistinctly seen in the midst of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
eager crowd, struggled ineffectually to
raise himself from the ground, where he
had fallen.</p>

<p>“I am hurt a little,” said the voice of
Harry Muir. “Never mind, it is not
much, I dare say. Some of you help me
up.”</p>

<p>There was a rush to assist him; a burst
of eager inquiries.</p>

<p>“I got a blow from the hoof; ah! I
can’t tell what it is,” gasped the young
man, over whose face the pallor of deadly
sickness was stealing. He could not
stand. They carried him—these rough
strong men, so gently—with his friends
crowding about him, to the nearest surgeon’s.
Everybody was sympathetic;
every one interested. But Harry Muir’s
head had sunk upon his breast, and the
fight had gone from his eyes. He was
conscious of nothing but pain.</p>

<p>The accident was a serious one; his leg
was broken.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">AS YOU LIKE IT.</span>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Cuthbert</span>,” said Richard Buchanan,
“do, like a good fellow, go and tell his
wife.”</p>

<p>“Do you not see, man, that a stranger
would alarm her more? Why make me
the messenger? You say she knows you,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“Ay, she knows him,” said the second
brother, “but she does not know him for
any good. You see, Cuthbert, Dick’s
always enticing poor Muir away—as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
did to-night—and the wife wouldn’t flatter
him if he went up now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a straw for the wife,” said
Richard angrily. “It’s yon grim sister
Martha, and that white-faced monkey of
a girl. I say, Cuthbert—you needn’t go
in, and they don’t know you—do go before
and tell them he’s coming. I’ll come up
with him myself in the noddy—just to
oblige me, Cuthbert, will you go?”</p>

<p>“He lives in Port Dundas-road, it’s not
very far. John will show you where it
is,” urged Alick.</p>

<p>Cuthbert consented to go; and the
obstreperous John was very much subdued,
and very ready to accompany his
cousin to poor Muir’s house. It was now
nearly ten o’clock. The young men were
all greatly concerned, and in an inner
room poor Harry was getting his leg examined,
and looking so deadly sick and pale
as to alarm both surgeon and friends. It
was his temperament, so finely organized,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
as to feel either pain or pleasure far more
exquisitely than is the common lot.</p>

<p>“What will you say to them? Man,
Cuthbert, are you not feared?” asked John.</p>

<p>“Why should I be feared? I am very
sorry for her, poor woman—but is she such
a fury, this wife?”</p>

<p>“It’s not the wife, it’s his eldest sister.
Dick went home with Muir one night
when he was’nt quite able to take care
of himself, and I can tell you Dick was
feared.”</p>

<p>“Dick was to blame—I do not feel that
I am,” said Charteris; “but why was he
afraid?—did she say so much to him?”</p>

<p>“She did’nt say anything to him; but
you know they say she’s awful passionate,
and she’s a great deal older than Harry;
and she’s just been like his mother.
They’re always so strict, these old maids—and
Miss Muir’s an old maid.”</p>

<p>“Wait, then, till I see, John,” said
Cuthbert; “don’t try to intimidate me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>“Yonder’s the house,” said John.</p>

<p>They had just passed a great quarry,
across which the dome of some large
building loomed dark against the sky.
Then there was a field raised high above
the road, with green grass waving over
the copestone of a high wall, and at the
end of the field stood a solitary house.
A house of some pretension, for it boasted
its street-door, and was “self-contained;”
and albeit the ground-floor on either side
was occupied by two not very ambitious
shops, the upper flat looked substantial
and respectable, although decayed.</p>

<p>They were on the opposite side—the
street was very quiet, and their steps and
voices echoed through it, so clearly that
the loud John sank into whispering and
felt himself guilty. The light of a very
pale moon was shining into one of the
windows. Looking up, Cuthbert saw
some one watching them—eagerly pressing
against the dark dull panes; as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
crossed the street, the face suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>“That’s one of them,” whispered John.
“Isn’t it awful that a poor fellow can’t
be out a little late, but these women are
watching for him that way?”</p>

<p>Cuthbert did not answer. He was
thinking of “these women,” and of their
watching, rather than of the poor fellow
who was the object of it.</p>

<p>They had not time to knock, when the
door was opened wide to them, and a pale
girl’s face looked out eagerly. She shrank
back at once with a look of blank disappointment
which touched Cuthbert’s heart,
“I—I beg your pardon—I thought it
was my brother.”</p>

<p>“Your brother will be here very soon.
He has done a very brave thing to-night,
and has had a slight accident in consequence.
I beg you will not be alarmed,”
said Cuthbert hastily.</p>

<p>“Oh! come in, sir, come in,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
young sister. “A very brave thing.”
She repeated it again and again, under
her breath.</p>

<p>“There’s the noddy,” whispered John,
as he lingered behind. “I’ll wait and
help him in.”</p>

<p>The door admitted into a long paved
passage, terminating in a little damp
“green.” John Buchanan remained at
the door, while Cuthbert followed the
steps of his eager conductor, through the
passage, and up an “outside stair,” into
the house. She seemed very eager, and
only looking round to see that he followed
her, ran into a little parlour.</p>

<p>“Harry is coming. He has been helping
somebody, and has hurt himself,
Martha; the gentleman will tell you,” exclaimed
poor Harry’s anxious advocate,
placing herself beside the chair where sat
a tall faded woman, sternly composed and
quiet.</p>

<p>“Is Harry hurt?” cried another younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and prettier person, who occupied the seat
of honour by the fireside.</p>

<p>“He has done a very brave thing;”
Cuthbert heard it whispered earnestly, into
the elder sister’s ear.</p>

<p>He told them the story. The little wife
was excited and nervous—she began to
cry. The sister Martha sat firmly in her
chair, her stern face moved and melting.
The younger girl stood behind, with her
arm round her sister, and her bright tearful
face turned towards Charteris. “Our
Harry—our poor Harry! it was this that
kept him, Martha—and he saved the
child.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do? Will he be lame?”
sobbed the little wife.</p>

<p>The grave Martha suddenly rose from
her chair as the faint sound of wheels
reached them. “He is here. Rose,
make the room ready for him, poor fellow.
Do not let him see you crying, Agnes.
Come to the door, and meet him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>They went away hastily, leaving Charteris
still in the room. Rose vanished by
another door into an inner apartment.
They were overmuch excited and anxious
to remember the courtesy due to a stranger;
and the stranger, for his part, was too
much interested to leave them until he
had seen how the sufferer bore his removal.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said a very small voice, “has
Harry come home?—Rose!” Charteris
looked round him a good deal puzzled, for
there was no visible owner of the little
voice. There certainly was a cradle in a
corner, but nothing able to speak could
inhabit that.</p>

<p>“Rose!”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Then there followed
a faint rustling, and then a third
door opened, and a little head in a white
nightcap, looked out with a pair of bewildered
dark eyes, and suddenly shrank in
again, when it found the room in possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
of a stranger. The stranger smiled
at his own somewhat strange position, and
began to move towards the door—but suddenly
the cradle gave sound of life, and a
lusty baby voice began to cry. They
were carrying the baby’s father then, into
the house. The good-humoured Cuthbert
rocked the cradle.</p>

<p>Poor Harry was still very pale, though
the surgeon who accompanied him was as
tender of him as the most delicate nurse,
and the strong young arms of the Buchanans
carried the patient like a child.
<i>They</i> made their escape immediately, however,—but
divided between sympathy for
the family, and a consciousness of his own
somewhat ridiculous position, Cuthbert
stood at his post, rocking the refractory
cradle. They all passed into the inner
apartment. He was alone again.</p>

<p>It was a very plain parlour, and various
articles of feminine work were scattered
about the room; some small garment for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the sleeping baby lay on the ground, where
it had fallen from the young mother’s
hand; on the table, where Martha had
been sitting, was a piece of fine embroidery,
stretched on two small hoops which
fitted closely into each other. She had
been engaged in filling up the buds and
blossoms of those embroidered flowers with
a species of fine needlework, peculiar to
Glasgow and its dependent provinces.
Another hoop, and another piece of delicate
work, remained where Rose had left
it. The sisters of the poor clerk maintained
themselves so.</p>

<p>The baby voice had ceased. Groans
of low pain were coming from the inner
room. Cuthbert felt that he did wrong to
wait, and turned again towards the door—but
just then Miss Muir entered the parlour.</p>

<p>“The doctor thinks he will do well,”
said Martha. “To-night I can hardly
thank you. But he is everything to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
all—poor Harry!—and to-night you will
excuse us. We can think of nothing but
himself. Come again, and let us thank
you?”</p>

<p>“I will come in the morning,” said
Cuthbert, “not to be thanked, but to hear
how he is. Good night.”</p>

<p>She went with him to the door, gravely
and calmly: when she had shut it upon
him, she stood still, alone in the dark, to
press her hands against her heart. Again—again!—so
long she had hoped that
this facile temper would be steadied, that
this poor brilliant wandering star would
be fixed in his proper orbit. So often, so
drearily, as her hopes had sunk into that
blank of pain. Poor Harry! it was all
they could say of him. When others
praised the gay wit, the happy temper,
the quick intelligence, those to whom he
was dearest, could only say, poor Harry!
for the good and pleasant gifts he had,
made the bitterness of their grief only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
deeper. Their pride in him aggravated
their shame. Darkest and saddest of all
domestic calamities these women, to whom
he was so very dear, could not <i>trust</i> the
man in whom all their hopes and wishes
centred. He had not lost their affection—<i>it</i>
seemed only the more surely to yearn
over and cling to him, for his faults—but
he had lost their confidence.</p>

<p>They could not believe him: they could
not rely upon word or resolution of his.
When Harry was an hour later than his
usual time of home-coming, Martha grew
rigid in her chair, her strong heart beating
so loud that almost she could not hear
those footsteps in the street for which
she watched with silent eagerness; and
the work fell from the hands of the young
wife, and Rose stole away, pale and agitated,
into the inner room, to watch at
the window in the darkness; and even
the little sister—the child—was moved
with the indefinite dread and melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
which is the grief of childhood. There
were many grave people who would have
smiled at poor Harry’s sins, and counted
them light and venial, but so did not
these.</p>

<p>To lose confidence in those who are
most dear to us, to be able no longer to
trust word or vow—it is the climax of
womanish misery,—a calamity terrible to
bear!</p>

<p>And Martha Muir, under this discipline,
was growing old. Morning after morning
there had been a rebound of eager hope,
only to be utterly cast down when the
night fell. She had had something of the
mother’s pride in him—had transferred to
Harry the natural ambition, the eager
hopes and wishes, which for herself had
all faded with her fading prime—and now,
she who had so strong a will, so resolute
a mind, to see this man with all his gifts,
and the free scope he had to exercise
them, sinking, falling, tarnishing with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
mean sins, the lustre and glory of his
youth. Poor Harry! his stern sad sister
said nothing more of blame—but as she
turned again along the damp passage, and
up the stairs, the heart within her sank
into the depths. She pressed her hands
upon it. Strange sympathy between the
frame and the spirit, which makes it no
image to say that there is a weight upon
the heart!</p>

<p>“Martha, has Harry come home,” said
the little sister, standing in her white
night-dress at the door of the small bed-closet
which opened from their parlour.
The child’s eyes were bright and wide
open, as if, in her compulsory solitude in
the closet, she had been steadily fixing
them to keep herself awake. “When I
looked out I saw a gentleman. And
where’s Rose and Agnes, Martha. Is
Harry no weel?”</p>

<p>“You must go to bed, Violet,” said
Martha. “Poor Harry has got a broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
leg. He was in the Trongate to-night
with the Buchanans, and saved a child’s
life—but you cannot see him to-night—the
doctor is with him just now, poor fellow;
go to bed—you shall see him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Little Violet began to cry, and the dark
bewildered wide open eyes looked up inquiringly
into Martha’s face. Violet knew
that Harry did not need to be in the
Trongate with the Buchanans, and that
they all waited for him very long before
they would take their humble cup of tea.</p>

<p>“He will not be able to go out for a
long time, Violet—and he saved the bairn’s
life,” said Martha, as she put her little
sister into the dark closet bed, which she
herself and Rose shared, “and you must
not cry—rather be thankful that the little
boy’s mother has not lost him, Lettie, and
ask God to bless poor Harry—poor Harry!
do you know you should always think of
him, Violet, when you pray?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p>“And so I do, Martha,” said little
Violet, looking up through her tears as she
clung to her elder sister, the only mother
she had ever known.</p>

<p>“Then you must let me go to him now,
poor fellow,” said Martha. “Hush! he
will hear you crying—lie still, Lettie, and
fall asleep.”</p>

<p>One of Violet’s tears rested on Martha’s
faded cheek—other tears came as she wiped
it away. “Poor bairn—poor bairn,” said
the elder sister, “I might be her mother—and
so I am.”</p>

<p>When she entered the sick-room, the
surgeon was just preparing to leave it.
He had set the broken bone, and done all
that could be done to give his patient ease.
Harry, greatly exhausted, and deadly pale,
was lying quiet, not strong enough to express
even his suffering by more than a
faint groan—and his wife and Rose watched
anxiously beside him. But Harry’s mind
was very much at ease, and tranquil. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
accident covered triumphantly any error
he had committed, and his anxious attendants
were tranquil and satisfied too—for
who could think of Harry’s fault or weakness,
when Harry’s generous bravery had
brought him so much pain. They were
content to believe—and they did believe,
poor eager loving hearts! that no one else
could have been so daring—no one else
had so little thought of personal safety—and
were saying, with tears in their eyes,
what a providence it was for the child and
its mother, that “our Harry,” and no
other, was there to rescue it.</p>

<p>“I am to sit up with him, Martha,”
said the little wife.</p>

<p>“But there is the baby, Agnes,” said
Rose; “you must let me sit up with
Harry.”</p>

<p>“You must go away, both of you, and
sleep,” said Martha. “Hush, speak low!
I cannot trust any of you, bairns—I must
watch him myself. No, little matron, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
you. I must take care of my boy myself—my
poor Harry!”</p>

<p>These words so often said—expressing
so much love, so much grief—they were
echoed in the hearts of all.</p>

<p>Poor Harry! but his conscience did not
smite him to-night: only his heart melted
into tenderness for those who were so very
tender of him, and involuntarily there
came into his mind, gentle thoughts of all
he would do for them, when he was well
again; for Harry never feared for himself.</p>

<p>They left his wife with him for a short
time, and returned to the fireside of the
little parlour—it was Saturday night, and
some of their delicate work had to be
finished, if possible, before the twelve
o’clock bell should begin the Sabbath-day.</p>

<p>They were but lodgers in this house.
The mistress of it, a decayed widow—strong,
in her ancient gentility—had
three daughters, who maintained themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and an idle brother by the same work
which occupied the Muirs. The collars and
cuffs and handkerchiefs of richer women,
embroidered by other workers, principally
in Ayr and Ayrshire, were given out at
warehouses in Glasgow, to the Muirs and
Rodgers, and multitudes of other such, to
be “opened,” as they called it—which
“opening” meant filling up the centre
of the embroidered flowers with delicate
open-work in a variety of “stitches” innumerable.
Very expert, and very industrious
workers at this, could, in busy times,
earn as much as ten weekly shillings—and
thus it was that Martha and Rose Muir
supported themselves and their little sister,
and were no burden on the scanty means
of Harry.</p>

<p>“Well, Martha?” said Rose, breathlessly,
as the door of the inner room closed upon
the little wife.</p>

<p>Martha could not lift up her eyes to
meet her sister’s. “Well, my dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>“I am sure,” said Rose, “I am sure,
you are quite satisfied to-night.”</p>

<p>“Surely, surely,” said the less hopeful
sister—a sigh bursting, in spite of her,
out of her heavy heart.</p>

<p>“Surely, surely—what do you mean,
Martha?” said the dissatisfied Rose.
“Poor Harry! you are surely pleased
with him to-night.”</p>

<p>“I said so, Rose,” said Martha. “Poor
Harry!”</p>

<p>The younger sister did not speak for a
moment—then she put her work away and
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“You will never trust him—you will
never trust Harry, Martha!”</p>

<p>Martha sighed. “I will trust God,
Rose.”</p>

<p>Rose Muir dried her eyes, and took up
her work again—there was nothing to be
said after that.</p>

<p>Martha was rocking the cradle softly
with her foot; and Martha, mother-like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
was fain to divert the younger heart, and
make it lighter than her own. “Our poor
wee Harry,” she said with a smile. “Did
you see what a strange nurse he had to-night?”</p>

<p>“Was it the gentleman?” said Rose;
“did you say anything to him, Martha—he
would think us very ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“I can trust the person who rocks our
cradle,” said Martha. “He is coming
back to-morrow to be thanked.”</p>

<p>“On Sabbath-day!”</p>

<p>“It is charity to come to Harry,” said
Martha. “Poor Harry, how every one
likes him!”</p>

<p>Their eyes were becoming wet again—it
was a relief to hear a quiet knock at the
parlour door.</p>

<p>The visitor was the younger Miss Rodger—a
large, soft, clumsy, good-humoured
girl, with a pleasant comely face. She
wore a broken-down faded gown, which
had once been very gay, and a little woollen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
shawl, put on unevenly, over her
plump shoulders, and her hair in its enclosure
of curl-papers for the night; ends
of thread were clinging to the fringes of
the shawl, and the young lady was tugging
it over her shoulders, conscious of
deficiencies below; but the good-humoured
offer to “take the wean,” or do anything
that might be needed, covered the
eccentricities of Miss Aggie’s general
house dress and appearance. The precious
child was not entrusted to her, but the
hoyden’s visit enlivened the sisters, and
immediately after, they finished their
work, and Martha saw Rose and Agnes
prepare for rest, and then took her own
place noiselessly by her brother’s bedside.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="allsmcap">GRAHAM.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> on the following morning, Cuthbert
Charteris, after a long walk from his
uncle’s house, presented himself at Harry
Muir’s door. The street was very still
and Sabbath-like. Some young workmen,
in suits of snowy moleskin, stood grouped
about the corner of the Cowcaddens,
enjoying the sunshine, and some few who
were of the more respectable Church-going
class, and could not spend the after-part
of the day in such a manner, were returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
from early walks. There were very
few shadows, however, to break the quiet
undisturbed sunshine of the usually
crowded street.</p>

<p>The blinds were all drawn down in
Mrs. Rodger’s respectable house—all except
one in the little parlour of the Muirs.
The outer door stood ajar—it was generally
so during the day—and as Cuthbert
proceeded up the stairs, the grave doleful
voice of some one reading aloud struck
on his ear. This, and the closely-veiled
windows, made him somewhat apprehensive—and
he quickened his pace in
solicitude for the sufferer.</p>

<p>The door of the house was opened to
him by a little slipshod pseudo-Irish girl,
who held the very unenviable situation of
servant to Mrs. Rodger. The door opened
into a large airy lobby, at the further end
of which was Harry Muir’s little parlour;
but Cuthbert’s attention was drawn to
another open door, through which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
a glimpse of a large kitchen, with various
figures, in strange dishabille, pursuing
various occupations in it—one engaged
about her toilette—one preparing breakfast—and
another trying to smooth out
with her hands the obstinate wrinkles of
a green silk gown. They were talking
without restraint, and moving about continually,
while, at a large deal table near
the window, with her back turned to the
open door, sat a tall old woman, in a
widow’s cap, with a volume of sermons
in her hand, reading aloud. The voice
was most funereal and monotonous, the
apartment darkened by the blind which
quite covered the window. One of the
daughters caught a glimpse of the stranger,
and hastily closed the door. Cuthbert
turned to the little parlour with a
puzzled smile.</p>

<p>The room was small, and furnished
with a faded carpet, an old sofa, half-a-dozen
ponderous mahogany chairs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the cradle which Cuthbert had rocked the
previous night. The little table was
covered with a white table-cloth, and
glancing with cups and saucers; and by
the side of the little clear fire the kettle
was singing merrily. Rose, in her Sabbath
dress of brown merino, stood at the
window with the baby. Martha, newly
relieved from her long night’s vigil in
the sick room, was cutting bread and
butter at the table; and in the arm-chair,
with great enjoyment of the dignity, sat
Violet, her attention divided between the
psalm she was learning, and the little
handsome feet in their snowy-white woollen
stockings and patent-leather shoes,
which she daintily rested upon the fender.
As Cuthbert entered the room, the young
wife looked out from the door of the inner
apartment, with her finger on her lip, to
telegraph that Harry had fallen asleep.
They were all of that sanguine mood and
temperament which springs up new with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the light of the morning, and even on the
pale dark face of Martha there were hopeful
smiles.</p>

<p>“The surgeon has been here already,”
she said, “and Harry is not suffering so
much as we feared he should. The symptoms
are all favourable, and we may hope
that it will have no ill results: the doctor
says that he will not be lame, poor fellow;
and now, Mr. Charteris, we have to thank
you for preparing us so gently last night
for the accident. It was very kind—very
kind—to take so disagreeable an office on
yourself, and not to leave it to your
cousins.”</p>

<p>“I can assure you they were sincerely
grieved,” said Cuthbert, “and are very
anxious about your brother.”</p>

<p>“They are only lads,” said Martha,
quietly, “and have not the consideration.
We could not trust youths like them, as
we can trust a more mature judgment.
For our own sakes, I am very glad, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Charteris, that <i>you</i> saw poor Harry’s accident,
and the cause of it—poor Harry!”</p>

<p>Cuthbert Charteris was very much interested—so
much so, that it did not
occur to him what a very unsuitable time
he had chosen for his visit—nor that the
teapot on one side of the old-fashioned
grate was beginning to puff a faint intimation
that it had been left there too long,
and that the kettle on the other was boiling
away. It was very nearly ten o’clock,
and, in a few minutes, the Church-going
bells would ring forth their summons.
Rose began to look embarrassed, and to
dread being too late for Church; but the
gentleman was talking to the baby and to
Martha, and steadily kept his place.</p>

<p>At last Rose, listening in terror for the
first notes of the bell, shyly suggested to
Martha that, perhaps, Mr. Charteris had
not breakfasted.</p>

<p>But Mr. Charteris had breakfasted;
and as Martha lifted the puffing teapot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
from the place which was too hot for it,
and bade Violet lay down her psalm-book,
and began to fill the cups, Mr. Charteris
drew his seat into the window, and kept
possession. He had settled himself already
quite on the footing of an old
friend, and began to feel it very pleasant
to sit there, looking out on the fresh
wintry sunshine, and the clean humble
families who began to set out in little bands
for the far-away old parish Churches of
Glasgow—not choosing to content themselves
with the Chapel-of-ease, politely
called St. George’s-in-the-Fields—profanely,
the Black Quarry. There were a
few such in this immediate neighbourhood,
who went to the Barony, and the
Tron and High Churches, as old residenters,
and rather looked down upon the
new. To look out on these—the mechanic
father and thrifty mother, and group of
home-spun children, embellished, perhaps,
with a well-dressed daughter, working in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the mills, and making money—and to
look in again upon the little bright breakfast-table,
and the three sisters—the
mature, grave, elder woman—the Rose, in
the flush of her fairest years, half-blown—the
little, shy, dark-eyed child—Mr.
Charteris felt himself very comfortable.</p>

<p>They had to speak very low, for Agnes
stole to the door of the inner room now
and then, to lay her finger on her lips
again, and telegraph the urgent necessity
for silence—and speaking in half whispers
makes even indifferent conversation look
confidential. The friendship waxed apace—very
rarely did such a man as Charteris
come within sight or knowledge of this
family. The atmosphere of commerce is
rarely literary—in their class they had read
of the fully equipped intellectual man, but
had met him never.</p>

<p>They themselves were of an order peculiar
to no class, but scattered through all;
without any education worth speaking of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
except the two plain indispensable faculties
of reading and writing, Harry Muir
and his sisters, knowing nothing of the
world, had unconsciously reached at and
attained the higher society which the world
of books and imagination opens to delicate
minds. They were not aware that their
own taste was unusually refined, or their
own intellect more cultivated than their
fellows, but they were at once sensible
of Cuthbert’s superiority, and hailed it
with eager regard—not without a little involuntary
pride either, to find that this,
almost the most highly cultivated person
they had ever met, was, after all, only
equal to themselves.</p>

<p>There are the bells, echoing one after
another, through the now populous streets.
Mrs. McGarvie, from the little shop below,
has locked her door, and issues forth, with
her good man, who is a rope-maker and
deacon of his trade, to the Barony Kirk,
with Rab, her large good-humoured red-haired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
son, and her little pretty daughter
Ellen, a worker in the mill, following in
her train; and with great dignity, in green
silk gowns and tippets of fur, Miss Jeanie
and Miss Aggie Rodger sail from the door,
bound for the Relief Meeting-house, while
Rose Muir ties on Violet’s neat bonnet,
and arranges her little cloak, and glides
away herself to complete her own dress,
wondering, with a little flutter, what Mr.
Charteris will do now.</p>

<p>Mr. Charteris very speedily decided the
question, for he stood waiting, with his
hat in his hand, when Rose entered the
parlour, cloaked and bonneted. Mr. Charteris
had never heard Dr. Jamieson. He
thought, if the young ladies would permit
him, he should be glad to walk with them
to the Church.</p>

<p>And the young ladies did permit him,
with much shy good will, and Mr. Charteris
listened to Dr. Jamieson’s fine voice
and polished sentences with great edification.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
The Doctor was a man in his prime,
bland and dignified, and knew all the economics
of sermon-writing, and that famous
art of domestic wisdom which makes a
little go a great way; nevertheless, Mr.
Charteris turned back some distance on the
road, when the service was ended, to animadvert
upon the Doctor, and to get up a
very pretty little controversy with Rose,
who, as in duty bound, refused to hear a
word in detriment of her minister, so that
the discussion carried Mr. Charteris back
again to the very door, and gave him
another prospect of the Misses Rodger’s
green silk gowns, at sight of which, raising
his hat, to the great admiration of
Violet, Mr. Charteris turned reluctantly
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following evening was signalised in
the quiet house of Mr. Buchanan, by such
a discussion as never before startled its
respectable echoes. Cuthbert Charteris,
lawless as Ishmael, lifted his hand against
every man, and refused to confess himself
worsted, though George Buchanan and
Sons, as a firm, and as individuals, not to
speak of Adam Smith, and the law of
supply and demand, were set in battle
array against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p>The subject of controversy was one
which would have made the blood boil
with indignation and wrath in the veins
of Harry Muir, being nothing less, indeed,
for a starting-point, than his salary, which
the advocate, looking on the matter in a
theoretical point of view, and not admitting
into his consideration the “everybody-else”
whose practice had so large a share
in forming the opinions of his cousins,
condemned very strongly and clearly, to
the great wrath of Richard and Alick, and
the half-convinced irritation of their father,
as quite an unfair and inadequate remuneration
for the full time and labours of an—at
least partially—educated man. Cuthbert
had not at all a commercial mind, and
the natural right and justice continually
overshadowed with him the laws of
supply and demand. It was impossible
to persuade him, that any law required of
him a systematic wrong, nor that a man’s
own personal conscience had nothing to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
with his position as an employer of other
men. Cuthbert would not be convinced—neither
would Dick and Alick—and Mr.
Buchanan himself, head of the firm and
the house, took up his candle abruptly
and went off, in some excitement, to his
own apartment, there to sleep upon sundry
propositions which had entered, like arrows,
sharp and irritating, into a mind which
would hear reason, whether its possessor
chose or no.</p>

<p>Cuthbert remained some weeks in Glasgow—he
had little practice to neglect at
home, and the western magnates made
much of him, greatly esteeming in their
hearts the metropolitan “rank” so very
different from their own, which they
affected to despise;—and the intercourse
which he had with the Muirs, already bore
a character of friendliness and confidence,
such as not unusually elevates an acquaintance
formed at some family crisis, into a
warm and lasting friendship. But Charteris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
at length was going home, and, not
without many jibes from his young cousins,
about the strange attraction which
drew him so often to visit the invalid, he
set out from the office for the last time to
see Harry Muir.</p>

<p>Very different is the look which this
bustling street bears in its every-day occupation
from the Sabbath quietness which
hushes all its voices. Great carts are constantly
passing with ostentatious din and
clamour, as if proud of their load—light
unburdened ones, flying up and down,
with the driver perched on his little movable
seat, and the end of the whip floating
like a streamer over his horse’s head—while
now and then wearied travelling people
come slowly down, carrying box and carpet
bag, fresh from the tedious journeys of
the canal. Violet Muir stands at the
door of the little room wherein Mrs.
McGarvie lives, and eats, and sells butter,
brose-meal, and “speldrens,” lovingly conversing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
with Tiger, Mrs. McGarvie’s great
ferocious, sinister-looking dog. He is by
no means prepossessing, this friend of
Violet’s, and has a wiry yellow coat, and
a head largely developed in the animal
parts, and small in the intellectual, with a
fiery red truculent eye;—yet, nevertheless,
he is Violet’s friend, and the little girl like
the fairy Titania, has beauty enough in
her own eyes and heart to glorify her
friend withal—so Tiger is sufficiently
adorned.</p>

<p>Shaking hands kindly in passing, and
patting the little shy head which drooped
under his eye, Cuthbert went up stairs
through the always open door to the now
familiar parlour. Harry was rapidly recovering;
he had been removed from his
room for the first time to-day, and now
lay on the sofa, while his little wife gaily
danced about the crowing baby before
him. They made a pretty group, as Agnes
leaned over the great arm chair, and little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Harry put forth his dimpled hand to
stroke his father’s cheek, but there was a
little peevishness and impatience in the
face which the rosy child’s fingers passed
over so lightly. The invalid was slightly
querulous this morning.</p>

<p>“Just the time of all the year that I
enjoy most,” said Harry, “and to be shut
up here now! It tries a man’s patience—open
the window, Rose.”</p>

<p>“Rose got cold last night, when you
had the window open,” said Agnes with
humility, “and the baby is not well—it
may hurt yourself too, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Rose can sit somewhere
else. Open the window.”</p>

<p>“Surely, if you wish it, Harry,” said
Rose promptly.</p>

<p>The day was bright, but cold, and the
wind blew in, with a sudden gust, through
the opened window, tossing poor Rose’s
hair about her face, and shaking her with
a momentary shiver, but saying nothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
she withdrew quietly to a corner and resumed
her work. Rose had never ventured
all her life to dispute any one of
Harry’s caprices.</p>

<p>“One likes to have a glance at the
world again,” said Harry, raising himself
on his pillows. “Yonder comes the postman,
Agnes—see, he is holding up a letter—run,
and get it, Rose; and yonder is
Rab McGarvie, carrying a peck of brose-meal
to somebody, and little Maggie
McGillivray clipping at the door. It is
pleasant to see them all, and this wind,
how fresh and wholesome it is. Lift the
window a little more, Martha—just for
a moment.”</p>

<p>“It is very cold, Harry,” pleaded the
little wife.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” repeated Harry, “don’t
you think it is quite warm for the season,
Mr. Charteris. Martha!”</p>

<p>Martha rose with sudden impatience,
threw down her work, and rapidly closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the window. She did not speak, but
Cuthbert saw a strange combination of
the strongly-marked lines on her forehead,
and a close compression of her lips, which
did not look very peaceable. The act
itself was not very peaceable certainly,
but there was a suppressed passion in her
look and manner, which had a singular
effect upon the stranger.</p>

<p>Harry Muir said nothing, but he threw
himself back upon the pillow, sullen and
offended. There was a scared timid expression
on the face of the young wife,
and little Violet glided up behind Martha,
and laid her hand upon her sister’s shoulder
in childish deprecation.</p>

<p>Just then Rose entered with the letter.
“It is from Ayr, from my uncle,” she said.
“Shall I open it, Harry?”</p>

<p>“As you please,” said Harry, sulkily.</p>

<p>She cast a hurried glance round the
room, pausing for a moment with a searching,
inquisitive, painful look, as her eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
fell on Martha. Then she came to her
brother’s side, and laid her hand softly
with a half caress upon his arm.</p>

<p>“Shall I read what my uncle says,
Harry, for everybody’s benefit? Uncle
Sandy always writes to the whole of us,
you know.”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Cuthbert took
up his hat, and rose with embarrassment.
The scene was becoming painful.</p>

<p>“You are not going away, Mr. Charteris,”
said Agnes, anxiously; “pray don’t
go away so soon, when this is your last
visit too; and I am sure Harry has never
had an opportunity before to thank you
for your kindness, nor indeed any of us,
except Martha. Martha had to make all
our thanks.”</p>

<p>“Did you, Martha?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>Cuthbert turned away his head. He
did not wish them to think that he saw
through those little palpable affectionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
artifices of theirs to heal the new-made
breach.</p>

<p>“Martha!” repeated Rose, under her
breath.</p>

<p>And Cuthbert looked stealthily at this
passionate face. The rigid lines were relaxing
slowly; the muscles of the mouth
moving and trembling; fierce and strong
anger melting into inexpressible tenderness
and sorrow. Vain anger, bootless
yearnings, which might spend their
strength for ages, like the great sea upon
the sand, and never change its form.</p>

<p>“Mr. Charteris, I fear, got but few
thanks from me,” said Martha, slowly;
“but Mr. Charteris has seen us since, and
knows that to do kindness to Harry is to
have the greatest gratitude we can feel.”</p>

<p>There was another pause, and the
stranger could easily perceive that, facile
as Harry was elsewhere, he liked to reign
at home, and did not very readily forgive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
any resistance to his will. He had, indeed,
been very querulous and unreasonable
this morning, and this was only the
climax of a series of petty selfishnesses
which had exhausted Martha’s powers of
long-suffering.</p>

<p>“Shall we see you soon in Glasgow
again,” asked Harry, at length, turning
once more to Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“In a few weeks, perhaps; I may have
some business,” said Cuthbert, with embarrassment.
“You will be strong again
then, I hope. My uncle commissions me
to say that you must take full time to recover,
and not hurry to the office too soon.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Buchanan is always very kind,”
said Agnes.</p>

<p>“Is he?” said Cuthbert, smiling,
“scarcely kind enough, I am disposed to
think; but I believe it is not the inclination
that is defective in my uncle. These
trammels of ordinary usage—doing as
other people do—have a great effect upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
men occupied as he is. He does not take
time to judge for himself, and exercise his
own generosity and justice.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert concluded in some haste.
Quite consistent as this apology was with
his own previous thoughts, it suddenly
occurred to him that it was quite irrelevant
and unnecessary here.</p>

<p>“Mr. Buchanan has done perfect justice
to Harry, I fancy,” said Martha Muir,
raising her thin figure from its habitual
stoop, and speaking in a tone of cold
<i>hauteur</i>, which, like the passion, revealed a
new phase of her character to Cuthbert,
who watched her with interest; “and as
for generosity, Mr. Charteris, your uncle
seems by no means deficient where there is
any scope for that. I see his name often
in the papers. You judge Mr. Buchanan
hardly.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert comprehended, and was silent.
Between the rich man’s indifference and
the poor man’s pride it was difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
steer; and Richard and Alick Buchanan
were not more haughtily offended at the
accusation of treating their clerks unfairly
than was Harry Muir’s sister at the suggestion
that his employer’s generosity
could reach him.</p>

<p>“This poor leg of mine is nearly a
month old now,” said Harry, “and except
some grave visits from Gilchrist, no one
has ever taken the trouble to inquire for
me. I suppose your cousins are more pleasantly
occupied.”</p>

<p>“I rather think Dick is afraid,” said
Cuthbert.</p>

<p>He was singularly unfortunate in his
choice of subjects. A little red spot began
to burn on Harry’s cheek; poor fellow, he
wanted to be angry.</p>

<p>“Afraid!”</p>

<p>“I mean, they would rather not encounter
the ladies till you are quite recovered.
Persuading you to go with them,
you know, burdens their conscience, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
it exposed you to this accident.
Not, of course, that any one was to blame,”
said Cuthbert, hurriedly, and with some
confusion.</p>

<p>“Their conscience is over scrupulous,”
said Harry, looking round him with a
smile of defiance. “I went with them
for my own pleasure; so far as there is
any blame it is entirely mine.”</p>

<p>Poor Harry!—weak and yielding as the
willow in the wind, there was no blame to
which he was so nervously susceptible as
this—no accusation which he denied and
defied with so much anger.</p>

<p>Cuthbert turned again to the window.
Just before him, in a half-built street,
which struck off at right angles from the
road to Port Dundas, Maggie McGillivray
sat in the cold sunshine on the step of her
mother’s door, “clipping,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with a web<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
of tamboured muslin on her knee and
scissors in her hand. Maggie, as Violet
Muir could have testified, was only sixteen,
though her “clipping” had helped
the family income for several years, and
her own money had purchased for her the
little bright red tartan shawl which just
covered her stout shoulders, but left her
arms unincumbered and her hands free.
On the half-paved road before her stood a
mill-girl, with whom work was “slack,”
and who had spent a full hour this morning
elaborating the beautiful plaits and
braids of her crisped hair. This young
lady, with much gesture and many superlatives,
was describing to the busy little
worker an itinerant show which had fixed
its temporary quarters at Port Dundas,
wherein there was a giant and a dwarf, a
beautiful lady who danced, and a boy who
had pink eyes, and which she herself was
on the way to see; but Maggie clipped
and shook her head, unfolding the web, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
show her tempter how much had to be
done before one o’clock, when she must
lay it by, to take up the pitcher with her
father’s broth, and carry to him his wholesome
dinner; and when the idler sauntered
on, to seek some less scrupulous companion,
Maggie returned to her labour with
such alacrity, that Cuthbert fancied he
could almost hear the sound of the shears,
and the loud clear lilt of the “Learig,”
to which they kept time.</p>

<p>Yet Maggie McGillivray was only a
humble little girl, while Harry Muir, in
his way, was an accomplished man. Cuthbert
looked back upon the young man’s
fine intelligent face, on which the proud
look of defiance still lingered, with a sigh
of pity and regret—not so would <i>he</i> have
overcome the temptation.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="allsmcap">OLD PLAY.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A self-willed</span>, proud, ambitious woman,
with a strong, clear, bold intellect, a passionate
temper, and vehement feelings,
Martha Muir had been born. So much
education as she had, tended all to reduce
her to the due humility of poverty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
womanhood, but surrounded always by
placid natures, who never fully comprehended
the stormy spirit with which they
had to deal, Martha, dwelling alone, and
hiding in her own heart the secret aspirations
which no one round her could have
understood, remained as proud, as self-willed,
and as ambitious as she had been
born.</p>

<p>For hers were not the hopes and fancies
common, as people say, to youthful women.
Advantages of appearance she had never
possessed, and the children who were growing
up at her feet absorbed all the passionate
affections of their grave sister;
but Martha’s hopes were visions of unmitigated
ambition, eager to work out for
itself a future worthy of its own bold
spirit—for it was not of windfalls, or happy
chances, or of fortune to be bestowed on
her by another, but of that ladder “to
which the climber upward turns his face,”
that the solitary woman dreamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>To raise them—these children—to that
indefinite rank and honour which exists in
the fancy of the young who are poor—to
win for them exemption from those carking
cares amid which her own youth, a
strong plant, had grown green and flourished.
Such hopes were strong in the
heart of the passionate girl when people
round her thought her only a child; and
when darker necessities came—when following
many little pilgrims, the father
and the mother went away, leaving her
the head of the sadly diminished family,
her strong desire, intensified by great
grief, possessed her like a fiery tormenting
spirit. She was then a woman of only
twenty years, while Harry was but thirteen;
and Martha prayed in an agony for
means—only means, to let her strong
energies forth and labour for her children:
but the means never came—how could
they? and all she could do in her passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of ambitious love was to toil day and
night for their bread.</p>

<p>No one of all her friends knew how to
deal with Martha—so that her impatient
soul knew no discipline except the inevitable
restraints of poverty, and these, if
they humble the pride, are but spurs to
the eager fancy, burning to escape from
their power. Through all the years of
romance the wish and hope to do somewhat,
had filled Martha’s mind with visions;
but then came those slow, gradual, steady
years, wherein the light of common day
began to blot out the radiant mists of the
morning, and as her hopes fell one by one,
and one by one the months lengthened,
filled with the tedious labour which gave
such scope for thought, bitterness came in
like deep waters into the fierce heart, which
rendered all its strength to that might of
disappointment, and wrestled with itself
like a caged eagle. To find that after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
aspiring to do all, one can do nothing—that
soaring in fancy into the broad firmament,
in the body one must condescend
to all the meanest and smallest cares of
daily life—to dream of unknown heights
to be attained, and to find instead that by
the slow toil of every long uninteresting
day one must labour for daily bread—it is
not wonderful that the awaking was bitter;
and all the more, because in both the dream
and the awaking she was uncomprehended
and alone.</p>

<p>They all lay dead these hopes of her
strange solitary youth—but as they died
others rose. This boy, in whom the young
beautiful life rose with a grace which she
knew it never had in herself—what might
he not do? and so she set herself to train
him. The old lore that is in all hearts, of
the brave and of the great, the histories of
Scripture, which live for ever; all that
God has recorded for us of his servants’
stout lives, and much that men have written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
in lesser records. The lonely young woman,
feeling herself grave and old among
her neighbours, poured all her vehement
heart into the glowing intelligence of the
boy. She began to think it well that those
chimeras of her own had fallen like withered
leaves to enrich the soil—and in him
should be the glorious spring.</p>

<p>How was it now? The deep red flush
which sometimes burned on Martha’s
cheek, the anger which only one of so
dear regard could awaken, and sadder still,
the utter heaviness with which her heart
sank in the rebound, proclaimed the end
of her second harvest. The first time she
had sowed in proud wilfulness—it was meet
she should reap disappointment; but the
second seed-time had been in hope more
Christianlike, and with strong crying for
the sunshine and the dew—the wonderful
sunshine and dew of high heaven, which
had never fallen upon her seed.</p>

<p>It seemed that her fate had been born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
with her. The proud and passionate
temper to be thwarted and crossed at every
turn—the vehement ambitious mind, to be
disgraced and humbled—and with those
arrows in her heart, she was now fighting
with herself a greater fight than she had
ever hazarded before, subduing herself to
herself, and to the Higher One, who thus
painfully had brought back the rebel soul
to His allegiance. It was hard to subdue
the old passion—the old pride—but she
had begun to sanctify her contest now,
when it had come to the bitterest.</p>

<p>No other trial could have been so hard
to her as this; it struck at her very life.
Misfortunes against which she could struggle
would have been happy discipline to
Martha, but to look on helplessly while
these elements of ruin were developing in
the life of her brother; to stand by and see
him fall lower and lower into the poor and
petty sins which she despised—to watch
the slow coming of disgrace and wretchedness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
which she could not lift a finger to
avert—who can wonder that the proud
spirit was chafed into passions of fierce
anger sometimes, and sometimes into very
despair; but Martha never spoke of what
she suffered—she only said “Poor Harry!”</p>

<p>“Shall I read my uncle’s letter now?”
asked Rose, when Cuthbert was gone.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Harry, whom some slight
incident had restored to perfect good-humour.
“Surely, Rosie, let us hear what
the old man says.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I write this to let you know that I
am quite well,” read Rose, “though a little
troubled with the rheumatism in my
right arm, which always comes on about
the turn of the year, as you will all mind;
and I am very sorry to hear of Harry’s
accident; but there is less matter for
lamentation, it being gotten in a good
way, as I have no doubt Martha will
mind. The town crier, Sandy Proudfoot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
broke his leg at Hogmanay, and it’s never
mended yet; but I cannot see what better
the daidling body had to expect, it being a
thing well known, that when the accident
was gotten, he was as he should not have
been, which is a great comfort in respect
of Harry. I hope all the rest of you are
well and doing well, and desire to see
some of you at Ayr as soon as ever it can
be made convenient. If Violet is inclined
to be delicate, send her out to me for a
change. The guard of the coach would
take good care of her, and I will pay her
passage myself. I hope she is minding
her lessons and learning to help the rest
with the opening, and that Rose is eident,
as the cottar says, and minds her duty
duly, and that Harry is steady and ’grees
with his wife. As for Martha, seeing she
knows what is right, better than I can
tell her, I have nothing to say, but that I
hope she keeps up to the mark, which she
knows, and has her own judgment in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
favour—of which, if she is sure, I know she
will be feared for no other in the world.
And so I remain, my dear bairns, your
affectionate uncle—<span class="smcap">Alexander Muir</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“What do you say, Agnes,” said Harry,
“do we agree?”</p>

<p>The little wife smiled. “When you
behave yourself, Harry,” she said, laying
her child in the cradle.</p>

<p>“If we could manage it,” said Martha,
“when Harry is able to walk, Agnes, I
think you should go down together to see
my uncle. You have never been in Ayr.”</p>

<p>Agnes looked up brightly. “And I
should like so well to go; and it would
do Harry so much good. But then, Martha,
how can we afford it?”</p>

<p>Harry winced visibly. Some debts of
his own, recklessly and foolishly incurred,
had made the long-projected journey to
Ayr impracticable a year ago; the fifteen
pounds could do so little more than provide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
for the bare wants of the quarter;
and yet again there were other debts
waiting for the next payment of salary.
Poor Harry!</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” said Martha,
quietly; “I see how we can manage, Agnes;
we shall only work the more busily, Rose
and I, while you are away, and Harry will
be the better of it. I see how we can do it.
It will do Harry good to see my uncle and
the little quiet house again.”</p>

<p>Harry felt that there was meaning in
her voice. To dwell again under the
humble roof where all her hopes for his
young life had risen; where she had nursed
and tended the dawning mind within
him, and laboured to lift his eyes, and
teach him to look upward bravely, like
a young eagle to the sun. Alas, poor
Harry! For this revival of the unstained
hopes of youth, Martha was willing to toil
all the harder at her tedious unceasing
toil; and he felt, almost for the first time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
how hopeless these hopes were. How
different were his expectations and hers.</p>

<p>“It is a shame,” he said, abruptly,
“for a rich man like Buchanan to keep
us down so. We require a little relaxation,
a little ease, as well as them; and I
should like to know how it is possible we
can get it on sixty pounds a year?”</p>

<p>“Peter McGillivray has only fourteen
shillings a week,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“And what then?”</p>

<p>“He keeps a family on it, Harry; at
least his wife does; but then she is very
thrifty.”</p>

<p>“Thrifty! nonsense. Is not Agnes
thrifty too? You are a foolish girl, Rose,”
said her brother; “you think a few shillings
is a great fortune. There now, a
pound or two would take us comfortably
down to my uncle’s; but how can we
spare that, off the pittance they give me.”</p>

<p>Yet Harry remembered that his own
private expenses—the little debts of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
his wife and sister knew nothing—amounted
to more than that needful pound
or two, and the remembrance brought a
flush to his face and made him angry.</p>

<p>“There is a meanness attends this mercantile
wealth,” he exclaimed hastily; “a
want of thought and consideration of
others. What are we clerks but the stuff
these masters of ours are made of? and
yet how they keep us down.”</p>

<p>“They were themselves kept down, and
overcame it,” said Martha.</p>

<p>“Well, it is not a very noble art, the
art of making money,” said Harry, with
assumed carelessness. “Dick Buchanan
and the rest of them are shallow fellows
in spite of it all. And their father—he
has made a fortune—but the honest man
is no genius.”</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i> a noble art to refuse to be
kept down,” said the ambitious Martha,
with a kindling of her eye. “I am
ashamed to think that Mr. Buchanan or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
any other ordinary person, <i>can</i> keep down
my brother; and he cannot, Harry. You
have less perhaps than you ought to have
now, but win more; that is your refuge.
And don’t let us throw the responsibility
on other people. We have only to answer
for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, Martha,” said Harry, looking
up, “we have not much of the mammon
of unrighteousness to answer for. I will
tell my uncle you have grown charitable;
that is, if it be at all possible to get to
Ayr.”</p>

<p>“What do you think, Martha?” said
Agnes, with some solicitude in her face.</p>

<p>“You must go; that is all,” said
Martha.</p>

<p>The little wife was by no means self-opinionated.
She had a great reverence
for, and faith in, the decrees of Martha, and
knew that what her grave sister resolved
would be accomplished “some way,” so
she returned pleasantly to the cradle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>“And <i>I</i> don’t want to go, Martha,”
whispered little Violet, desiring to have
her sacrifice appreciated. “My uncle will
give the money to Agnes, and I will stay
at home and help you to open.”</p>

<p>“But you would like to go, Lettie?”
said Rose.</p>

<p>“No; I would rather stay at home
with Martha and you. I think, Martha,”
whispered Violet again, “that it will be
fine to be our lane just for a wee while—when
Agnes is with Harry.”</p>

<p>In the elder mind there was a response
to the child’s thought—To know that
Harry was safe, with the good uncle, and
the anxious little wife to guard him, while
yet they themselves were left a little while
alone, freed from their constant anxiety,
to rest and take breath for the future
which remained, with all its unknown
cares, before them. There was something
in the thought which gave Martha relief,
and yet oppressed her with a heavier sadness;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
but Agnes was already gay in anticipation,
and eagerly discussing what
she should take of her little wardrobe, and
how many frocks for baby Harry—for
Agnes was still only a girl, and the unusual
pleasure filled her with wholesome
natural delight—a good and happy contagion
which soon spread itself in softened
degrees over all the rest.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">OLD SONG.</span>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I want</span> a next of kin, Charteris,” said
an Edinburgh W. S., entering the little
office where Cuthbert sat, solemnly considering
the morning’s paper, opposite an
elbow-chair, which had very seldom been
honoured by the presence of a client. “I
want a next of kin, and I can’t tell where
to find him.”</p>

<p>The speaker was a young man about
Cuthbert’s own age, who like himself had
newly begun to encounter on his own behalf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the cares and responsibilities of business.
They had come together through the
training of the High School and College,
and now were great friends and allies,
furthering each others progress, by all
means in their power.</p>

<p>“Advertise,” said the laconic Cuthbert,
from behind the folds of his newspaper.</p>

<p>“Oh, oracle!” answered Mr. David Lindsay,
throwing down a black crumpled
“<i>Times</i>,” which struck upon the fair broadsheet
of “<i>The Scotsman</i>,” and compelled the
reader’s attention. “And suppose I have
advertised, and failed—what then?”</p>

<p>“It’s a cold day, Davie,” responded the
learned advocate. “Sit down, Lord Lion,
and tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“I say, Cuthbert, there’s a story,” said
the W.S., mysteriously.</p>

<p>Cuthbert stirred the fire, and prepared to
listen.</p>

<p>“Up near the links of Forth, there is
a gray old house called Allenders,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Lindsay, with some importance, “and in
the house there dwells a family as your
penetration will guess—or rather, dwelt a
family—for they are now extinguished—Allenders
of Allenders—and between four
and five hundred a-year; now that’s what
I want a man for, Cuthbert.”</p>

<p>“Between four and five hundred a-year,”
repeated Cuthbert gravely. “I
would take it myself, to oblige you,
Davie.”</p>

<p>“Thank you—I could get lots,” said
the representative of the poet King-at-Arms.
“But the right man, Charteris—by-the-bye,
I should say the right woman—the
right two women—where to lay my
hands on them!—”</p>

<p>“So the heir is extant after all,” said
Cuthbert; “you know that, do you?”</p>

<p>“Wait a little, and I’ll tell you what I
know. They have always been a highly
respectable family, these Allenders, mind,
and you know what that means; comfortable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
slow, common-sense folk, with no
hair-brained sentimental traces about them.
Well! the last father of them had seven
sons—there was no appearance of a lack
of heirs then—and one of the sons, the
third or fourth I think, took it into his
head to be a—what is your newest philosophical
name for it—the Allenders said a
sentimental fool—which means, you know,
that he married somebody.”</p>

<p>“I beg to assure you that there is no
sort of philosophy in that achievement,
Lion,” said Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt me, Charteris—why,
man, a romantic episode in the history of
a dull family is a treasure. This son—his
name was John—everybody’s name is John—married
some poor girl or other in Stirling;
and thereupon followed a regular
tragic disowning of the refractory son.
The good people were startled out of their
propriety; never an Allenders had been
known before, to do anything out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
ordinary jog-trot, and the example of his
daring aroused his father and his brethren.
They cast him out—they banished him
from the paternal countenance, and from
all hope of ever inheriting the paternal
acres, and so left him to seek his fortune,
as he best could. That was seventy years
ago.”</p>

<p>“Seventy years! why, the man must
be dead,” said Charteris.</p>

<p>“Very possibly. It does not concern
me that,” said Lindsay. “Well, Charteris,
this sentimental John got some sort of
situation in Stirling, and was by no
means annihilated by the family ban. He
throve and multiplied for a few years—then
his wife died suddenly, leaving him
with two daughters, and then he disappeared.</p>

<p>Where he went to, there is not the
least clue. The man was half mad with
grief, I suppose. It was said he was
going to England—and it was said he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
going to America. It seems quite impossible
to discover—every trace of him is
gone. And now all the seven sons are
exhausted; after all, it must be best to be
stagnant, Charteris—for see you, whenever
this romance stepped in among the
decent people, what a blight it brought
upon them. Four of them died unmarried—other
two had children who have grown
old and died during the lingering lifetime
of the last proprietor. He was a
childless widower—and now the old man
has gone too; and where am I to get
those heirs?”</p>

<p>“Did he know nothing of them,” said
Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“Nothing; he died very old—upwards
of ninety—and his senses failed him; but
his memory seems to have turned with a
strange kind of affection to this poor sentimental
lost John. There are some far
away cousins who would claim as heirs,
but the old laird left a will, ordaining that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
search should be first made for the children
of John Allenders—children! they will
not be quite youthful now.”</p>

<p>“And there is no trace?” said Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“None, but a rather fantastic one,”
said Lindsay, smiling. “The favourite
female name of the Allenders’ family was
Violet—old Allenders thought it certain
that one of those children would be called
Violet—and their mother’s name was Rose.
What’s the matter, Cuthbert?”</p>

<p>“Strange!” said Cuthbert, looking up,
with a start. “Why, I met a family in
Glasgow, last month, in which there were
both these names.”</p>

<p>“Ay—where? what’s their name? who
are they?” said Lindsay eagerly.</p>

<p>“Their name is Muir—they are rather
a noticeable family in many respects,”
said Cuthbert, with a little hesitation;
“but so far as pecuniary matters go, very
humble people. Could it be? Rose and
Violet—there can be no mistake about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
names. I’ll tell you what, Lindsay, I’ll
go through, myself, to the west, and find
it out.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks. I had no idea you
took so much interest in these professional
investigations,” said Lindsay, with some
curiosity, “I think it is more in <i>my</i> department
than yours, Cuthbert.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know them, Davie—you’re
an alien and a foreigner, and an east
countryman—whereas my mother is a Buchanan!
I am free of the city, Lion, and
then, I know the Muirs.”</p>

<p>“Well, Cuthbert, you know your own
secrets, I suppose,” said Lindsay, laughing,
“and whether all this is pure professional
zeal, or no, I won’t inquire; but
as for your rubbish about east countrymen,
you don’t mean me to believe that,
you know. Of course, if you are acquainted
with the family, that is a great matter.
But mind, be cautious!”</p>

<p>“Look at ‘<i>The Scotsman</i>,’ Davie,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Cuthbert, “and keep silence, while I read
your advertisement. There now, be quiet.”</p>

<p>Two stories up in the honourable locality
of York Place, lived Cuthbert’s mother.
They were not very rich, certainly, but
the old lady had a sufficient portion of
the means of comfort, to prove her a
Buchanan. She was a little, brisk, active
woman, under whose management everything
became plentiful. It was not an
economical propensity, but, refined and
somewhat elegant though Mrs. Charteris’
own individual tastes were, it was an indispensable
thing with her that there
should be “routh” in her house. So
there were dependants hanging about her
door at all times, and stores of bread and
broken meat dispensed to all comers. Mrs.
Charteris had unlimited faith in her two
neat, blooming, sister servants. She
thought they could discriminate the line
between plenty and waste, almost as distinctly
as she did herself—yet when Cuthbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
returned home that day he found his
mother delivering a short lively lecture
on the subject—a lecture such as was
rather a habit of hers—to the elder of the
two trusted confidential maids.</p>

<p>“You see, Lizzie, my woman, to lay
the moulins out of the bread-basket on
the window-sill for the sparrows is very
kindly and wiselike—a thing that pleases
me—but to crumble down one side of the
good loaf that we’re using ourselves, is
<i>waste</i>. You see the difference. It might
have been given to some poor body.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mem,” said Lizzie, demurely,
“and so I did. I gi’ed the ither half o’
the loaf to Marget Lowrie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Charteris looked grave for a moment.
“We were using it ourselves,
Lizzie; but to be sure, in a house where
there’s plenty, there should aye be the
portion for folk that have more need, and
as long as its lawfully used, Lizzie, I never
find fault, but to waste is a great sin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Now, you’ll mind that, and take the moulins
after this for the sparrows.”</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Cuthbert, mem,” said Jess,
the younger sister of the two, returning
from the door, and the little active old lady
rustled away in her black silk gown to her
parlour, to see what had brought home her
son at so unusual an hour.</p>

<p>The parlour or drawing-room, for it
might be called either, was a handsome
room, though it was on the second story,
and its very comfortable furniture had an
air of older fashion than the present time,
which suited very gracefully with the age
of its mistress. Near one of its large
windows stood an antique spider-legged
table, bearing a work-box of somewhat
elaborate manufacture, an open book, with
Mrs. Charteris’ silver thimble lying on it
for a mark, and Mrs. Charteris’ work by
its side—while within reach of these stood
an easy chair and a footstool. The spring
was brightening rapidly, and Mrs. Charteris’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
chair stood always in this window,
when the weather permitted her to leave
the fireside—for here, as she plied her
sewing, or glanced up from her book, she
could observe the passengers in the street
below, and watch for Cuthbert as he came
home from his little office. Cuthbert had
a slight look of excitement to-day, his
mother thought, as she took off her spectacles,
and looked at him with her own
kindly unassisted eyes. Mrs. Charteris
fancied her son had perhaps got a brief.</p>

<p>“Well, Cuthbert, my man, what brings
you home so soon?” said Mrs. Charteris,
sitting down in her chair, and drawing in
her footstool.</p>

<p>“I think I will go through to Glasgow
to-morrow, mother,” said Cuthbert
hastily.</p>

<p>The old lady looked up with her glasses
on. There was certainly an unusual flush
and a happy embarrassed smile upon the
face of her good son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>“The laddie’s possessed!” said Mrs.
Charteris. “What would you do in Glasgow
again so soon. It is not a month
since you came home, Cuthbert?”</p>

<p>“Neither it is, mother,” said the advocate,
“but I have got some business in
hand—a mystery, mother, to exercise my
legal judgment on.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Charteris was interested. “Aye,
what’s that?”</p>

<p>There was a good deal of hesitation
about the learned gentleman—it was evident
there was no fee in this case.</p>

<p>“I told you about that young man,
mother,—that family of Muirs.”</p>

<p>The old lady looked up quickly. She
was a good deal interested in this family
of Muirs, partly because her son had
spoken much of them, and still more
because he seemed so very willing to return
to the subject. “What about them,
Cuthbert?”</p>

<p>“I had Davie Lindsay with me to-day,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
said Cuthbert, lifting up and turning over
the pages of his mother’s book. “He is
very anxious to trace out the heirs of a
small old estate near Stirling, and I’ve a
notion these Muirs are the people he
wants.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Charteris dropped her work on her
knee, and looked up with much interest.</p>

<p>“The lost heir had two daughters called
Rose and Violet,—rather a singular conjunction.
Now the two younger Muirs
bear these names—a strange coincidence,
if it is nothing else; and if one could help
such a family—I told you how much they
interested me, mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the old lady; “Violet—that
was the little girl—I heard you mention
her—but which of them is Rose?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cuthbert Charteris looked a little
foolish, and withdrew into the shadow of
the curtain, which fortunately was green,
and neutralised the slight unusual flush
upon his face. “One forgets these girls’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
names,” he said, with a short laugh,
“though this is rather a pretty one. The
elder one is Martha, you know, mother—a
grave enough name to make up for the
romance of the other two—the intermediate
young lady is Rose.”</p>

<p>“How old is she, Cuthbert?” interrogated
his mother.</p>

<p>“I really am no judge—I could hardly
guess—quite young though,” said Cuthbert
hurriedly, “but the similarity of
names is very striking, and if I could
trace out a relationship, I should be exceedingly
pleased, mother; besides, that
one is bound, as a matter of duty, to assist
in proving a birthright in any circumstances—and
this young man will never
do in business, it is clear—whereas he
might make a capital country gentleman.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Charteris was a little prejudiced.
She shook her head: “It is not so easy
to make a gentleman, Cuthbert; the transition
from sixty pounds a-year to five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
hundred, though it must be very comfortable,
no doubt, will never accomplish
that.”</p>

<p>“Harry Muir, mother,” said Cuthbert,
“is not a wise man by any means—at
five and twenty, I scarcely think I was
very wise myself—but Harry Muir with
his sixty pounds, is a gentleman already.
I am afraid Dick Buchanan would suffer
very greatly, if you saw them together,
and compared the two.”</p>

<p>“Ritchie Buchanan is your cousin,
Cuthbert,” said the old lady, warmly.
“He is called after my father, who <i>was</i>
a gentleman, though he was not so rich as
his son. To be sure these laddies were
very loud the last time I saw them, and I
believe Ritchie had a ring, and no glove
upon his hand—but still, Cuthbert, you
must not be an ill bird.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall see,” said Cuthbert,
smiling. “Wait till I show you Harry
Muir, mother—no discredit to Dick, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
any of them—but my uncle’s clerk is a
very different person; poor fellow!—if
he only had half as much prudence as the
youngest of them, it would be better for
him. He is of that class, who, people
say, are nobody’s enemies but their own.”</p>

<p>“And that is just the most hopeless
class of all, Cuthbert,” said Mrs. Charteris;
“you may cure a bad man that has pith—you
may turn a vessel that is ballasted
and steady, into another course—but for
your bits of gay pleasure-boats that float
with the stream—alack and woe is me!
It is a hopeless work, Cuthbert: you never
tried your hand at anything so vain.”</p>

<p>“That is the sister’s work, not mine,
mother,” said Cuthbert, “and I can believe
it is not a very promising one—but in the
meantime, I must try and lay my hands
upon the clue which will conduct Davie
Lindsay to his end, and give him an heir
to Allenders. Of course, I will not speak
of it to the family, till I have ascertained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
something more about these names—but
I think the result is very likely to be what
I heartily wish it may.”</p>

<p>“I will wager you a silver crown, Cuthbert,”
said Mrs. Charteris, “that the bairn
is called after old Mrs. Violet Primrose
of Govan, and that Mrs. Hervey of Monkland,
is the name-mother of the elder
one; and to make it the more appropriate,
to-morrow is the first of April, and Davie
Lindsay has sent you on a gouk’s errand,
for a credulous callant as you are; now
mind, I told you.”</p>

<p>“Very well, mother, we shall see,” responded
Cuthbert.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">OLD PLAY.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not without a little embarrassment
that Cuthbert presented himself next
day at the office of his uncle. It was the
day before the despatch of one of the
mails, and everybody in the office was
very busy. Round the desk of Mr. Gilchrist,
the cashier, who had the capital
business head, and the two hundred yearly
pounds, the snuff lay in little heaps, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
all the clerks of meaner degree were working
furiously, with scarcely time to interchange
now and then, the usual <i>badinage</i>
of the counting-house; while, in Mr.
Buchanan’s room, Richard sat writing
letters beside his father.</p>

<p>“Better get away out of town, Cuthbert,”
said the merchant, “we shall be
late to-night; but your aunt and Clemie
are at home, and are always glad to see
you, you know, whereas we shall only bore
you, if you wait for us. I think you had
better go down to Greenbank at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, uncle,” said Cuthbert. He
was quite resigned to postpone his enjoyment
of their company for a few hours.
“I have some business to do, but I shall
get home before you, I think.”</p>

<p>“I say, Cuthbert,” said Richard in an
aside, “why don’t you ask for Harry
Muir? I believe you’ve been there already.”</p>

<p>“Then you believe nonsense, Dick,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
said Cuthbert, with a little heat. “How
is he, poor fellow?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone down to Ayr. Oh, he’s
recovering fast,” said Richard. “These
women made it worse than it was, you
know, with their lamentations. I suppose
you’re going to call, Cuthbert?”</p>

<p>“I am going to look after a case which
my friend Lindsay is engaged in,” said
Cuthbert, with some dignity. “I must
do that before I make any calls. There
now, that will do—you are sure to be late
with your letters, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I should not wonder,” mused Dick
Buchanan, as Cuthbert made his escape,
“if his business was in Port Dundas after
all.” And the curious young merchant
endeavoured to discover, through the
opaque window, which course his cousin
took; but the endeavour was quite unsuccessful.
The dim yellow pane preserved
Cuthbert’s secret.</p>

<p>It was past mid-day when Cuthbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
reached the busy road to Port Dundas.
It was, as usual, noisy and loud, and
crowded, with echoing carts on its causeway,
and streams of mill-girls pouring
along its pavement, returning to the factories
after dinner. Little stout round
forms—faces sometimes sallow, but by no
means unhealthy—hair dressed with extreme
regard to the fashion, and always
excellently brushed, and in the finest
order—made these passengers, in their
coloured woollen petticoats and bright
short gowns, a very comely part of the
street population. Very true most of
them planted broad, sturdy, bare feet
upon the dusty pavement; but the free
loud mirth, no less than the comfortable
habiliments, showed them quite removed
from the depressing effects of extreme
poverty—as indeed they were.</p>

<p>And opposite Harry Muir’s house, in
the little half finished street, Maggie
McGillivray still sat clipping, with her brisk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
scissors in her hand, sending her loud clear
voice into the din like an arrow—and still
another branch of the Glasgow feminine
industry, came under the amused observation
of Cuthbert, before he reached the
little parlour.</p>

<p>Miss Aggie Rodger, with her large
shoulders bursting from under the little
woollen shawl, and a great rent in the
skirt of her faded large-patterned cotton
gown, sat on the highest step of the stair,
holding in her hand a very dingy piece
of embroidered muslin, which she was
jerking about with wonderful rapidity as
she “opened” it. Miss Aggie, like the
humbler clipper, was lightening her task
with the solace of song; but, instead of
the clear flowing canty “Learig,” Miss
Aggie, with great demonstration, was
uttering the excellences of the Rose of
Allandale. Both the natural voices were
tolerably good; but Cuthbert thought he
preferred Maggie McGillivray’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>In the little “green,” to which the
paved passage from the street directly led,
Miss Rodger, the elder sister, was laying
out the collars and caps of the family to
bleach. Miss Rodger was, in her way,
a very proud person, and had a severe
careworn face, which, six or seven years
ago, had been pretty. From the green,
Cuthbert heard her addressing her
sister:</p>

<p>“Aggie, haud your tongue. Folk would
think to see ye that you kent nae better
than the like of that lassie McGillivray.
They’ll hear ye on the street.”</p>

<p>“Ye can shut to the door, then, if ye’re
so proud,” responded Miss Aggie, drawing
out the long quavers of her song with
unabated zeal.</p>

<p>Miss Jeanie, the prim intermediate sister,
looked out from the kitchen window,
and interrupted the dialogue in a vehement
whisper:—“Aggie, will ye come
out of that, and no let yoursel be seen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
such a like sicht as ye are? do ye no see
the gentleman?”</p>

<p>Miss Aggie looked up—saw Cuthbert
standing below—and, snatching up the
torn skirt of her gown in her hand, fled
precipitately, leaving behind her a considerable-sized
dilapidated slipper, trodden
down at the heel, which had escaped from
her foot in her flight.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost yin o’ my bauchals. Throw
it into us, woman, Jean—what will the
strange man think?” cried Miss Aggie,
disconsolately, as she reached the safe refuge
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Miss Jeanie was dressed—for this was
the day, on which they carried home their
finished work, to the warehouse which
supplied them. Miss Jeanie was very
prim, and had a little mouth, which she
showed her appreciation of, as the one
excellent feature in a tolerable face, by
drawing her lips together, and making
them round. She was magnificently arrayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
in a purple silk gown, bound round
the waist with a silken cord, from which
hung a superb pair of tassels. This dress
was by far the grandest article of apparel
in the house; and with great awe and
veneration, Violet Muir had just intimated
to her sisters, that Miss Jeanie was
going to the warehouse, and that she had
on, her Adelaide silk gown. Adroitly extending
the skirt of this robe of state to
cover the unlucky “bauchal” of Miss
Aggie, Miss Jeanie primly stood by the
open door, admitting the visitor, and
Cuthbert entered without making any
further acquaintance with the family.</p>

<p>The same universal feminine work re-appeared
in the parlour, where Martha sat by
the window in her usual place, busy with
her usual occupation, while Rose, seated by
the table, and occasionally pausing to
glance down upon an open book which lay
before her, listened with a smile, half of
pleasure, half of amusement, as Violet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
standing by her side, with a glow upon
her little pale face, poured forth page after
page of the Bridal of Triermain. Martha
too, raised her eyes now and then, with a
smile of playful love in them—for little
Lettie’s low-voiced intense utterance, and
enthusiasm, refreshed and pleased the
heart which knew so many harder sorrows
than the evils of romance. Rose was
Violet’s governess; in an evil hour the
young teacher had bidden her pupil choose
any poetry she liked for her task, and
learn as much of it as pleased her. Now
Violet did at that time particularly affect
the minstrelsy of Sir Walter, and the result
was, that already one canto of Triermain
had been accomplished, and another,
and another, remained to say.</p>

<p>Out of doors in the sunshine, Maggie
McGillivray sang the “Learig,” and with
a gay flourish of her shears accompanied
the swell of the “owerword,” as she ended
every verse. At the window in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
kitchen, Miss Aggie Rodger sat in a heap
upon the table, and stayed her needle in
mid-course, while she accomplished the
Ro-o-se of A-ah-allandale; and within
here the little form of Violet expanded,
and her small face glowed, as her story
progressed; while Rose smiled and worked,
and glanced at the book; and Martha,
with fresh and genuine pleasure, listened
and looked on. After all, the gift of song
is a fair gift to this laborious world.
There was nothing very grand or elevated
in either the ballads or the fable, yet enough
to stir the heart, and keep the busy hands
from weariness—and to do that, is to do
well and merit a hearty blessing of the
world.</p>

<p>Cuthbert was loth to disturb this pretty
home scene, as he did at his entrance; but
notwithstanding, Cuthbert was very well
satisfied with the bright surprise and shy
pleasure, which one at least of the little
group displayed, and took his place among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
them like an old friend. Violet’s copy-book
lay open on the table; and Violet
made very bad pot-hooks indeed, and hated
the copy intensely, though she liked the
poetry. The copy lines set for her were
not very beautiful either, though they
were written in a good, sensible, female
hand, which had some individuality in it,
and was not of the fashionable style. Such
copy lines! stray lines out of books, as
diverse and miscellaneous as could be collected,
differing most widely from those
sublime, severe, abstract propositions,
which in common cases introduce the
youthful student to wisdom and half-text.
Cuthbert could not help a visible smile as
he glanced over them.</p>

<p>“I have interrupted my little friend’s
lesson,” said Charteris, as he laid down the
book.</p>

<p>Rose was shy of him. She did not answer.</p>

<p>“Violet has a great appetite for verse,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
said Martha, “we shall have all the rest
of it at night.”</p>

<p>“Triermain.” Cuthbert was a little
surprised that the child should be so far
advanced—innocent Cuthbert! he did not
know what a host of books, of all kinds
and classes, the little Violet had devoured
already.</p>

<p>“How is Mr. Muir?” asked Cuthbert.
“I heard at the office he was not at home,
and I was very glad to find that he was
able for travelling. Have you heard from
him? How is he?”</p>

<p>“He is getting strong rapidly, Agnes
writes,” said Martha. “They are with
my uncle in Ayr. We were brought up
there, all of us, and so we say Harry has
gone home. I hope it will strengthen
him—every way,” she added, with a suppressed
sigh.</p>

<p>“And so you like Sir Walter, Violet,”
said Cuthbert; “come and tell me what
you have read besides Triermain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>Violet came shyly to his side, and
drooped her head, and answered with
bashfulness, “I have read them a’.”</p>

<p>“Read them all! not quite, I think—how
many books have you read, altogether?”
said the puzzled Cuthbert.</p>

<p>Violet looked up with mingled astonishment
and pity, and opened her eyes wide.
She, who had already begun to look at advertisements
of books, and to tease Mr.
Syme, the librarian in the Cowcaddens,
about new publications, which he had
never heard of, and which in the ordinary
course, would not reach him these hundred
years—she to be asked how many
books she had read! Violet was amazed
at the want of apprehension, which such
a question displayed.</p>

<p>“I have read a great heap—and I can
say the Lord of the Isles, by heart, and
bits of the Lady of the Lake.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert’s ignorance had given Violet
a little courage; but as she met his eye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
her head drooped again, and she relapsed
into her former shyness.</p>

<p>“And how old are you, Violet?”</p>

<p>“I shall be eleven next May.” Violet
had already had very grave thoughts on
this subject of her age. It seemed a stupendous
thing to pass that tenth milestone.</p>

<p>“Violet—where did you get that pretty
name of yours,” said Cuthbert, drawing
his hand over her small dark head.</p>

<p>“It was my mother’s name,” said the
little girl reverently.</p>

<p>The conversation came to a sudden
pause. Conscious that he had a motive in
asking those seeming simple questions,
Cuthbert felt confused, and could not go
on—so he turned to the copy-book.</p>

<p>“Have you written all this yourself,
Violet?”</p>

<p>He had gone back to the beginning, and
there certainly was to be traced the formation
of a different hand from Violet’s—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
respectable, womanly writing which
had placed those odd copy lines on the
later pages; he traced it as it improved,
through a good many different steps of
progress, and at the end found a clear,
good-looking signature, proclaiming it to
be the work of Rose A. Muir.</p>

<p>“Rose A. Muir,” he repeated it unawares
aloud.</p>

<p>The bearer of the name started with a
slight blush. Martha glanced at him
with grave scrutiny—and little Violet,
looking admiringly at her sister’s handwriting,
explained, “Rose was called after
my grandmother.”</p>

<p>“It is not a common name,” said Cuthbert,
growing embarrassed under the grave
eye of Martha. “May I ask Miss Rose,
what is represented by this A.”</p>

<p>“It will be Anne or Alice, or some
stupid woman’s name,” he said to himself,
while his heart beat a little quicker.</p>

<p>“I was called after my grandmother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Mr. Charteris, as Lettie says,” said Rose,
shyly. “It is Rose Allenders—that was
her name.”</p>

<p>The young man started visibly. He
had no idea of falling on anything so clear
as this; but Martha looked at him with
sudden curiosity, and he felt himself compelled
to make some explanation.</p>

<p>“It is by no means a usual name, Miss
Muir,” said Cuthbert, turning to the elder
sister. “I know something.—I am
slightly acquainted with a family called
Allenders. Did this lady—your grandmother,
Miss Rose—come from the east
country?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, indeed,” said Rose.
“She died very long ago—before any of
us were born.”</p>

<p>“I think they came from London,” said
Martha; “I have heard my uncle say so—there
were two sisters of them; and
their father died in Ayr. Mrs. Calder, in
the old town, was very kind to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
orphans, and took them in: and there the
younger sister—her name was Violet—died;
and my grandmother married Mrs.
Calder’s son. I have heard she died
young too, and called her only child, who
was our mother, after her little sister. It
is a sad story altogether; but we heard
my uncle speak of it often; and I remember
how many of the old people in Ayr
recollected Rose Allenders.”</p>

<p>“My mother’s name was Violet Calder,”
said Lettie, “but I am only plain Violet.
She did not call me after all her name;
but Rose has got two names because she’s
after my grandmother.”</p>

<p>“I am going further west,” said Cuthbert.
“I shall be in Ayr for a day or
two, I believe. I think I must ask you
to introduce me to your uncle, Miss Muir.”</p>

<p>“He will be glad to see you,” said
Martha, quietly. “But if you go now,
you will find Harry established there.
Give Mr. Charteris my uncle’s address,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Rose—but indeed you hardly need that,
for every one knows my uncle.”</p>

<p>But Cuthbert had not the least desire
to meet Harry in Ayr. So he was careful
to excuse himself, and suddenly discovered
that he could not be able to make acquaintance
with Alexander Muir, the uncle,
for a full fortnight, by which time it was
certain that Harry must have returned.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> by day passed, of Harry Muir’s last
bright week at Ayr—passed no less happily
to the three sisters, than to himself
and his little wife—and at last, fresh,
healthful, and in high spirits, the youthful
couple and their baby returned home.</p>

<p>To walk to the coach-office to meet
them, was of itself a jubilee for the home-dwellers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and Mrs. Rodger herself held
the door open for them, in stately welcome.
Mrs. Rodger was a tall old woman,
gaunt and poverty-stricken, in her dingy
widow’s cap, and black cotton gown; but
Mrs. Rodger had been “genteel” once,
and never forgot it. She extended one
of her long arms, and gave Harry’s hand
a swing, as he stopped to greet her. “I
was just telling our weans,” said Mrs.
Rodger, “that the house wasna like itself,
wanting you—and I hope you find your
leg strong, Mr. Muir; bless me, how the
wee boy’s grown! I would scarce have
kent him; bring him ben, Violet, and
let the weans get a look o’ him. What
a size he’s turned!”</p>

<p>Miss Aggie, the youngest of the aforesaid
weans, plunged out of the kitchen,
and seized the baby with loud expressions
of admiration. The little wife was easily
flattered by praise of that blue-eyed boy
of hers, and was by no means unwilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
to accompany him herself, and exhibit
him to the assembled “weans” in Mrs.
Rodger’s kitchen.</p>

<p>This apartment, which answered all
purposes to the family, was a good-sized
room, showing an expanse of uncovered
floor, not over clean, and a great wooden
“bunker” for coals, as its most noticeable
feature. The “bunker” is an article
which belongs exclusively to the household
arrangements of Glasgow. This one
was not very high as it happened, and on
the corner of it sat Miss Jeanie, her hands
busy with her work, her feet deposited on
a chair below. Miss Aggie, in like manner,
occupied a corner of the table in the
window. Their work required a good
deal of light, and they were fettered by
no punctilios as to attitude. Miss Rodger,
the eldest sister, flitted in and out of a
dark scullery—and withdrawn as far as
possible from the light, in the dusky corner,
by the fireside, sat a shabby and not very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
young man, with shuffling indolent limbs
stretched across the hearth, and pins, the
sole gathering of his idleness, stuck in the
lappel of his dusty, worn coat, and a face
that promised better things. This was
“Johnnie,” as they called him, Mrs.
Rodger’s only son. Poor Johnnie had
begun this sad manner of life by a long
illness, and now, between his rheumatism
and his false shame, incapable, as it
seemed, of any strenuous endeavour to
make up for what he had lost, had sunk
into the state of an indolent dependant
upon the little earnings of his sisters.
They had their faults, these women; but
never one of them murmured at the burden
thus thrown upon them. Living very
meanly, as they were constrained to do,
they were still perfectly content to toil
for Johnnie. It never seemed to occur to
them at all, indeed, that the natural order
of things was reversed in their case. Sometimes,
it is true, there was a quarrel between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the mother, who was a termagant,
and the poor indolent shipwrecked son,
whose temper was easily galled, having
always this sore consciousness to bear it
company—but never one of the sisters upbraided
Johnnie, or made a merit of
labouring for him. Amidst all their
vanity, and vulgarity, this one feature
elevated the character of the family, and
gave to those three very common-place
young women, a standing-ground of which
no one could possibly be less conscious
than they were themselves.</p>

<p>The large good-humoured hoyden, Miss
Aggie, danced the baby in her arms, and
carried him to the fireside to her brother.
Poor Johnnie took the boy more gently,
and praised him to his mother’s heart’s
content, while Violet, no longer shy, but
at present very fluent and talkative, stood
by the side of her special friend and ally,
Mr. John. The little girl and the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
indolent man, were on very intimate
terms.</p>

<p>“I was just telling our weans,” repeated
Mrs. Rodger, “that the wee boy
would be just another creature after a
while in the country; and cheeks like
roses you’ve gotten yoursel, Mrs. Muir.
It would be unco’ dull though, I’m thinking—if
it had only been the saut water—but
its no the season for the saut water. I
mind when Archie was living—that’s their
father—we gaed down regular to Dundoon,
and it was just a pleasure to see the weans
when they came hame.”</p>

<p>“Agnes, Martha says the tea’s ready,”
said Violet, “and I’m to carry little
Harry ben.”</p>

<p>The tea-table in the parlour was pleasantly
covered, and still more pleasantly
surrounded, and Agnes’ basket, which the
good uncle’s own hands had packed, remained
still unopened; so the baby was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
given over to the safe keeping of Rose,
and the busy young wife began to distribute
uncle Sandy’s tokens of remembrance.</p>

<p>“This pot of honey is for you, Martha,—uncle
Sandy thought you would like to
give it to us all, now and then, on high
days—and here is a bottle of cream from
Mrs. Thomson, at the corner, and a little
silk handkerchief to Rose, and the last of
the apples to Violet—and see here, look,
all of you, look!”</p>

<p>Two little flower-pots carefully packed
with moss, one of them bearing a tuft of
fragrant little violets, the other proudly
supporting a miniature rose-bush, with one
little bud just appearing from its green
leaves—good gentle uncle! He had been
at so much trouble getting this fairy rose,
and cherishing it in his little sitting-room,
till this solitary bud rewarded his nursing.
It was hailed with a burst of delight
from Violet, and by the elder sisters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
with a pleasure which almost reached to
tears.</p>

<p>“It is so like my uncle,” said Rose.</p>

<p>And then with some happy excitement,
they gathered round the tea-table.
Harry had a great budget of local news to
open, and the blithe Agnes interrupted
him every moment to tell of her first impressions,
and new acquaintance. There
had been beautiful weather, sunny and
soft, as it often is in the early part of
April, and the young wife had left all
cares behind her on the grave shoulders
of Martha. Harry had been so well, so
happy, so considerate—enjoying so thoroughly
the simple pleasures of his old
home, and the society of his pure unsophisticated
uncle—Agnes thought she
had never been so happy.</p>

<p>And Harry’s face was sparkling with
healthful blameless pleasure. He looked
so man-like, the centre of their anxieties
and wishes, and was in reality so fresh-hearted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
and capable of innocent enjoyment,
that Martha’s troubled heart grew glad
over the success of her experiment. He
had been home—he had seen again in
these old scenes, the pure heroic fancies of
his earliest youth, and many days hence
the anxious sister thought the happy effect
would remain.</p>

<p>They closed the evening, as it was always
closed in the house at Ayr—with
the simple and devout worship of the
family. Harry, with his fine mind so
clear to-night, and happily elevated, a
young household priest, conducted those
simple fervent devotions—for the religious
emotions were strong within him. They
swayed him much sometimes, as, unfortunately
other feelings swayed him at other
some; but he was deeply susceptible at
all times to all the beauty, all the grandeur
of the holy faith he professed. The
young man’s voice trembled, and his heart
swelled as he appealed to the Great Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
for the sake of the wonderful Son. And
as, most humbly and earnestly, he asked
for strength against temptation, the tears
in Martha’s eyes were tears of hope—almost
of joy. She thought that surely
never again this young ingenuous spirit
would fall—never again forsake that holy
brotherhood, at whose head He stands,
who was once tempted for the sake of us—to
defile its garments with the mean sins
of former times. There was a shadow of
deep quiet upon all their faces as they rose
from their knees; they thought they had
come to the beginning of a purer, happier
time. They, these anxious women, thought
so for him; and he, poor Harry! for himself,
with those joyous eyes of his, looked
forward to the future, without fear.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was gay as the other maidens—all the springs and
hopes and youthful things of the world were like me:
prithee, lady, think not I say so out of envy of your
fair estate; for in good sooth, youth is estate enough
for a free heart. But before youth goes, troubles come—yourself
must meet them anon—and be not fearful,
gentle one; for it may be they will leave rare wealth
with you, and take but a little sunshine away.”</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="allsmcap">OLD PLAY.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Harry entered blithely
upon his old duties again. The morning
was sunny, and bright, and Agnes stood
at the window with the baby, to watch
him as he emerged from the outer door
below, and turned to look up to her, and
take off his hat in playful salutation. He
had a little cluster of fresh spring primroses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
pulled last morning in the Ayr
garden, gracing his button-hole, and there
was a spring in his step, and an elastic
grace in his manner as he went away, that
made glad the heart of the little wife.
They were all very blithe this morning—the
gladness came involuntarily from
Agnes’ lips in the familiar form of song;
she sang to the baby—she sang to them
all.</p>

<p>She was still a girl, this pretty wife of
Harry Muir—a girl belonging to that
very large class, who never discover that
they have hearts at all, until they have
sent them forth on some great venture,
perilling all peace for ever. Agnes had
been a very gay, perhaps a rather foolish
girl—liking very greatly the small vanities
which she could reach, and managing to
keep out of sight the graver matters of
life. She knew what it was to be poor—but
then she had known that all her life,
and the difficulties fell upon elder people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
not on herself, and Agnes sailed over them
with innocent heedlessness. The heart
slumbered quietly in her bosom—she
scarcely knew it was there, except when
it beat high sometimes for some small
merry-making; scarcely even when she
married Harry Muir were those gay placid
waters stirred. She liked him very much—she
admired him exceedingly—she was
very proud of him—yet still she had not
found out her heart.</p>

<p>But when the cloud began to steal over
the gay horizon of her life—when she had
to watch for his coming, and tremble for
his weakness, and weep over his faults
those sad apologetic tears, and say, poor
Harry! then this unknown existence began
to make itself felt within the sobbing
breast of the little, pretty, girlish wife.
The sad and fatal weakness, which made
him in a certain degree dependant upon
them—which aroused the feelings of
anxious care, the eager expedients to protect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
him from himself, gave a new character
to Agnes. In sad peril now was the
happiness of this young, tender, sensitive
heart; but the danger that threatened it
had quickened it into conscious life.</p>

<p>He went away with smiles, and hopeful
freshness to his daily labour. He came
home, honestly wearied, at an earlier hour
than usual, having his conscience free of
offence that day. So happily they all
gathered about the little tea-table; so
gaily Agnes presided at its tea-making,
and Martha placed on the table the little
crystal vessel full of honey—odorous
honey, breathing out stories of all the
home flowers of Ayr—so much the travellers
had still to tell, and the dwellers at
home to hear.</p>

<p>“And now, Martha,” said Harry, “put
on your bonnet, and come out. I believe
she has never been out, Agnes, all the
time we have been away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Harry—Martha was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
always at the Kirk,” said the literal
Violet.</p>

<p>“But we are not going to the Kirk to-night—come
Martha, and taste this April
air.”</p>

<p>Martha looked at her work. “It is
a temptation, Harry; but I think you had
better take Rose—see, Rose looks white
with working so long, and I have to go to
the warehouse to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To the Candleriggs!” said Harry,
laughing. “Where you scarcely can tell
when it is June and when December; and
if Rose is white, you are absolutely green
with sitting shut up here so long—come,
Martha.”</p>

<p>It was not very complimentary, but the
pallid faded cheek of Martha actually bore,
to eyes which had been in the sunshine, a
tinge of that undesirable hue. Save for
the beneficent rest of the Sabbath-day, and
the walk through the hushed streets to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
church, Martha had indeed, since her
brother went to Ayr, never been out of
doors. The luxury of sending Harry to
the pure home atmosphere was not a cheap
one. She had been labouring for, while
he enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“But what if Mr. Charteris comes?”
said Rose, with a little shyness: no one
else seemed to remember that Mr. Charteris
was to come.</p>

<p>“We shall not stay long,” said Harry;
“you must keep him till we return.”</p>

<p>Rose seemed half inclined to go too;
but she remembered how often Martha
had sent her out to enjoy the walk which
she had denied herself; and there were a
great many “holes,” as those very prosaic
sempstresses called the little spaces in the
centres of the embroidered flowers, at which
they worked, to be finished before they
were returned to the warehouse to-morrow—so
even at the risk of a little additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
conversation with the formidable Mr.
Charteris, Rose made up her mind to
stay.</p>

<p>And Martha and Harry went out alone.
They were not within reach of any very
pleasant place for walking, but they struck
off through some of those unsettled transitionist
fields which hang about the outskirts
of great towns, to the side of the
canal. Those soft spring evenings throw
a charm over the common place atmosphere,
of even such ordinary haunts as this—and
it is wonderful indeed, when one’s
eyes and heart are in proper trim, how the
great sky itself alone, and the vast world
of common air, in which we breathe, and
through which human sounds come to us,
can suffice to refresh our minds with the
Nature, which is beautiful in every place.</p>

<p>The distant traffic of the “Port,” to
which this canal is the sea; the flutter of
dingy sloop sails, and a far-off prospect of
the bare cordage, and brief masts of little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Dutch vessels, delivering their miscellaneous
cargoes there, gave a softened home
look, almost like the quiet harbour of some
little seaport, to a scene which, close at
hand, could boast of few advantages. But
the air was bright with the haze of sunset,
and in the east the sky had paled down to
the exceeding calmness of the eventide,
lying silently around its lengthened strips
of island cloud, like an enchanted sea. Dull
and blank was the long level line of water
at their feet, yet it was water still, and
flowed, or seemed to flow; and along the
bank came the steady tramp of those strong
horses, led by a noisy cavalier whose accoutrements
clanked and jingled like a
steam-engine, piloting the gaily-painted
“Swift” boat from Edinburgh, with its
crowds of impatient passengers, to the end
of their tedious journey. These were
homely sights—but the charmed atmosphere
gave a harmony to them all.</p>

<p>And there were some trees upon this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
side of the canal—and grass as green as
though it lived a country life, and stout
weeds, rank and vigorous, by the side of
the way—and the hum of the great town
came softly on their ear, with here and
there a distinct sound, breaking the inarticulate
hum of that mass of busy life.
Better than all these, there was such
perfect confidence between the brother and
sister, as had scarcely been before, since
he was the unstained boy, innocent and
ignorant, and she the eager teacher, putting
forth a second time in this young
untried vessel, the solemn venture of her
hopes. It was not that Harry had anything
to confide to the anxious heart,
which noted all his thoughts and modes
of feeling so narrowly; but the little daily
things which sometimes have so weighty
a bearing upon the most important matters
of life—the passing fancies, the very
turns of expression, which show the prevailing
tone of the speaker’s mind, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
so frankly visible to the eye of the watchful
sister, that Martha’s heart rejoiced
within her with solemn joy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rose sat alone in the parlour
doing her work, somewhat nervously,
and hoping fervently that Mr. Charteris
would not come till “somebody was in”
to receive him.</p>

<p>The baby lay sound asleep in the cradle.
Agnes had gone down to Mrs. McGarvie
to negotiate about some washing, and was
at this moment standing in Mrs. McGarvie’s
kitchen, near the small table where Mrs.
McGarvie herself, with the kettle in one
hand, and a great horn spoon in the other,
was pouring a stream of boiling water
into a bowl half filled with the beautiful
yellow peasemeal, which keeps the stomachs
of Glasgow in such superlative order, compounding
the same into brose, for the
supper of Rab, who newly come in, had
just removed his blue bonnet from his
shaggy red head in honour of his mother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
visitor. Mrs. McGarvie had undertaken
the washing, and Agnes in her overflowing
happy spirits, was telling her about the
journey, from which they had just returned.</p>

<p>Violet, last of all, was in Mrs. Rodger’s
“big room,” a very spacious, fine apartment,
which was generally occupied by
some lodger. They had no tenant for it
at present, and were this evening entertaining
a party in the large, lofty, shabbily-furnished
dining room. Violet had gone
in among these guests with the natural
curiosity of a child, and poor Rose, nervously
apprehensive of the coming of this
formidable Mr. Charteris, sat in the parlour
alone.</p>

<p>Her busy fingers began to flag as she
filled up these “holes;” and now and
then, the work dropped on her knee. The
ordinary apprehensions about Harry, which
generally formed the central object of her
thoughts, were pleasantly hushed to-night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Rose was not thinking about anything
particular—she would have said so, at
least—but for all that, long trains of
indefinite fancies were flitting through her
mind, and her thick blunt needle was
altogether stayed now and then—only
recovering in hysteric bursts its ordinary
movements, when Rose trembled to fancy
that she heard a step on the stair. If
Agnes would only come in—if Harry and
Martha were but home again!</p>

<p>At last a step was on the stair in reality.
“Maybe it is Agnes,” said Rose to herself
as her needle began to fly again through
the muslin—but it was not only Agnes—it
was the foot of a man—poor Rose wondered
if by any possibility she could run
away.</p>

<p>And there he was, this sad ogre whom
Rose feared, quietly opening the parlour
door, as if he had some right to be there.
Mr. Charteris was almost as shy as Rose
herself. He sat down with pleased embarrassment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
and looked exceedingly awkward,
and spoke by no means so sensibly
as he was used to do. Rose eagerly explained
the reason why she was alone, and
went to the window in haste to look for
Agnes.</p>

<p>Mr. Charteris’ eye had been caught by
something of a very faded neutral hue,
in a black frame, which hung above the
mantelpiece. He asked Miss Rose if it
was embroidery.</p>

<p>Miss Rose was moved to laughter, and
her laugh dispersed the mist of shyness
very pleasantly. “It is only an old sampler
of my grandmother’s, Mr. Charteris.”</p>

<p>Mr. Charteris rose to look at it.</p>

<p>“There is not much art in it,” said
Rose, “it seems that all the landscapes
on samplers are of one style—but my
mother gave it to me when I was a girl—a
little girl—and I used to be proud of it,
because it was my own.”</p>

<p>Mr. Charteris took it down to examine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
its beauties more closely. It bore the
name of the artist at full length “Rose
Allenders,” and had a square house, and
some very original trees, like the trees
of very old paintings, elaborately worked
upon it.</p>

<p>“I think you said she had been long
dead,” said Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“Long ago—very long ago,” said Rose.
“When my mother was only a child, my
grandmother died. Her name is on the
stone, among the rest of the Calders, and
her father and her little sister are near
her, in the churchyard. Uncle Sandy
used to take us there when we were children.
I believe he thought they would
feel lonely in their very graves, because
they lay among strangers.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Cuthbert again
hung up the faded sampler, and Rose
worked most industriously at her opening.
Each was earnestly endeavouring to invent
something to say—and both of them were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
singularly unsuccessful. It was the greatest
possible relief to Rose to hear Harry’s voice
in the passage.</p>

<p>The two young men greeted each other
heartily—it seemed that there was some
charm in these very faults of poor Harry—for
everybody learned to like and apologise
for, even while they blamed him.</p>

<p>“And so you are going to Ayr,” said
Harry, “why did you not come a little
earlier, Mr. Charteris, that I might have
shown our town to you. You will not
appreciate the beauties it has, unless some
one, native to it, points them out.”</p>

<p>“For which cause I am here to seek an
introduction which Miss Muir promised
me to your uncle,” said Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“To my uncle? are you a character
hunter, Mr. Charteris?” said Harry
quickly, and with something which Rose
thought looked like rudeness.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so—but why do
you ask me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>“Because the vulgar call my uncle a
character and an original,” said Harry.
“I thought your cousin, who saw him
once, might have told you so,—and he
does not like the imputation. We are
jealous of my uncle’s feelings, as we have
a good right to be, for he has been father,
and teacher, and companion alike to all
of us.”</p>

<p>“I had some business in the neighbourhood
of Ayr,” said Cuthbert, with a little
conscious embarrassment—“one of those
things in our profession that border upon
the romantic,—there are not many of
them, Miss Rose;—I want to trace out
some links of descent—to find some lost
members of an old family. I shall find
them only by means of gravestones I apprehend,
but that will answer my purpose.
It is not quite in my department, this
kind of business; but it is pleasant to
have some excuse for seeing so fine a
country in this time when ‘folk are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
longen to gon on pilgrimages.’—I think
you must begin to feel this longing, Miss
Muir?”</p>

<p>“It is wonderful how easily one can
content oneself,” said Martha, with a smile
which spoke of singular peace. “We
have only to shut our eyes, Rose and I,
and straightway we are at home—or to
send some one else to enjoy it, Mr. Charteris.
Harry and Agnes, have brought
us so much of the atmosphere that I
scarcely desire it now for myself.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuthbert Charteris</span>, much against his
will, was detained a week longer in Glasgow.
His uncle, a man of unbounded
hospitality, an almost invariable characteristic
of his class, was not without a
little family pride in Cuthbert’s attainments
and position—and such a succession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
of people had been already invited to
“meet” Mr. Buchanan’s advocate nephew,
that Cuthbert’s good humour, though
already sufficiently taxed, would not suffer
him to disappoint them.—Neither was it
until the very last evening of the week,
when he had made positive arrangements
for going to Ayr next day, that he had
leisure to call on the Muirs.</p>

<p>The sun was setting on the soft April
evening, and the slanting level sunbeams
streamed through the dusty streets, drawing
out in long shadows the outline of
the houses. Within these shadows the
bystanders felt almost the chill of winter,
while in the sunshine at the street corners,
lounging groups congratulated each other
that summer had come at last.</p>

<p>Here the light fell on a white “mutch”
or two, and on the sun-burnt heads of
innumerable children, of whose boisterous
play the gossip mothers took no notice.—There
it glimmered and sparkled in braids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and curls, and plaits of beautiful hair
which a <i>coiffeur</i> might have studied for the
benefit of his art, and which you could
scarcely fancy the short thick toil-hardened
fingers of these laughing mill-girls able to
produce. But toilsome as their factory
life was, it had its edge of enjoyment,
quite as bright and enlivening as the
evening recreations of any other class—and
with those young engineer workmen
clustering around them, and the evening
sunshine and the hum of continual sound—sound
which expressed repose and sport,
and scarcely had the least admixture of
the laborious din of full day—filling the
atmosphere, there were many scenes less
pleasant and less graceful, than the street
corner and its groups of mill-girls. And
here, up the broad road, now almost free
of the carts which usually crowd it, dashes
at full speed a bright little equipage glowing
in green and gold, which draws up
with a flourish at the corner. Straightway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the “closemouths,” and “common
stairs” pour forth a stream of girls and
women, carrying vessels of every form and
size, from the small china cream-jug from
some lonely lady’s tea-table, to the great
pitcher under which little Mary staggers
as she carries it home in her arms to
supply the porridge of a dozen brothers
and sisters; and you never were refreshed
with richer milk under the deepest umbrage
of summer trees, than that which
gives forth its balmy stream from the
pretty green barrels hooped with brilliant
brass, which rest upon the light framework
of the Port Dundas dairy cart.</p>

<p>Rose Muir stood at the door as Cuthbert
approached—he had chosen a later hour
than usual for his visit, that he might not
disturb them at their simple evening meal—but
as he glanced at the downcast face
of Rose, over which an uneasy colour was
flushing, he saw that the old anxiety, the
origin of which he had guessed at before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
had now again returned. The long wistful
glances she cast along the street—the
eager expectant look with which she turned
to himself—once before the herald of poor
Harry—would have almost sufficed to
reveal the secret of the family to Cuthbert
had he not guessed it before.</p>

<p>“Harry has not come home yet,” said
Rose, with an unconscious apology in her
tone; “they are sometimes kept very late
at the office—but my sisters are up stairs,
Mr. Charteris, will you come in?”</p>

<p>Cuthbert followed her silently. He had
become so much interested in the fortunes
of the family, that he felt his own heart
sink, as he remembered that “the office”
had been closed a full hour ago.</p>

<p>Agnes was alone when they entered the
parlour, and Cuthbert, roused to observation,
saw her sudden start as they opened
the door, and the pallor and sickness of
disappointment which came over her pretty
youthful face, when her eye fell upon himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
The work she had been busy with,
fell from the fingers which seemed for the
moment too nervous to hold it. The little
wife had been so confident—so sure of
Harry’s reformation,—and her heart was
throbbing now with a positive agony of
mingled fear and hope.</p>

<p>Cuthbert seated himself on the sofa, and
began to talk of the baby—it was almost
the only subject which could soothe the
young mother—but even while he spoke,
he could see how nervously awake they
both were to every sound; how Rose suspended
her work and held her breath at
every footstep in the street below which
seemed to approach the door—and how the
needle stumbled in the small fingers of
Agnes, and the unusual colour flickered on
her cheek.</p>

<p>“You are very late, Harry,” said
Martha, entering from the inner room—Cuthbert’s
back was towards her—she
thought it was her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<p>“It is Mr. Charteris, Martha,” said
Rose.</p>

<p>There was a fiery fight in Martha’s eyes—an
impatience almost fierce in the evident
pang, and short suppressed exclamation
with which she discovered her mistake.
She too had been strong in her renewed
hope—had began to rest with a kind of
confidence in the changed mind of Harry.</p>

<p>But now the former chafing had commenced
again, and the bitter hopelessness
which once before overpowered her, returned
upon her heart—Cuthbert thought
of the old grand picture of the bound Prometheus—of
the lurid background, and
the cold tints of the captive figure, rigid
in his manacled strength, with the vulture
at his heart. Bitterest of dooms, to be
bound to this misery, without one free
hand to struggle against it.</p>

<p>But Martha took her seat in silence,
and a conversation was very languidly
carried on. Insensibly Cuthbert felt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
same anxiety steal over himself—he felt
that he <i>ought</i> to go away, but yet he remained.
By degrees the conversation
dwindled into broken remarks from himself,
and faltering responses from Rose and
Agnes; sometimes indeed Martha spoke,
but her words were harsh and bitter, or
else full of a conscious mockery of lightheartedness,
which was more painful still.</p>

<p>The tea-tray with its homely accompaniments
stood on the table—the little kettle
sang by the side of the old-fashioned grate,—but
the night was now far advanced, and
reluctant to shut out the lingering remains
of daylight, the sisters had laid
aside their work; it was almost dark, and
still Harry had not come.</p>

<p>“Where is Violet, Agnes,” said Martha,
after a long silence.</p>

<p>“She went out to play,” said the little
wife. “Some of her friends were down
here, and they wanted her. I could not
keep Lettie in, Martha, on so fine a night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>

<p>“I was angry at the poor bairn,” said
Martha, with a singular humility, “I did
wrong. I will go myself and look for
her—our troubles are not so few that we
should make additions to them of our own
will.”</p>

<p>There was a strange pathos in the low
tone in which Martha spoke, and in the
sudden melting of the strained vehement
heart. Cuthbert saw the trembling hand
of Agnes steal up to her eyes, and heard
the appealing deprecatory whisper of Rose,
“Oh Martha!” He could see its meaning—he
could hear in it an echo of that
other exclamation—poor Harry! so common
in this house.</p>

<p>Little Violet had been at play in the
street below, carrying the vague blank
grief of childhood into her very sport.
As Martha rose, the little girl suddenly
burst into the room. “Agnes, Harry’s
coming.”</p>

<p>They were all very quiet—a sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
hush of deep apprehension came upon
the sisters, and Rose went out hastily to
the door.</p>

<p>In another moment, Harry had entered
the room—looking very pale, and with
an unmeaning smile upon his face. He
came forward with great demonstration
to greet Charteris, and hurried over an
elaborate account of things which had detained
him—the strangest complication of
causes, such as came in no one’s way
but his.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you light the candles?”
said poor Harry, with an ostentatious endeavour
at high spirits. “Have you been
sitting in the dark like so many crows?
Rosie, quick, light this, and get another
candle. You don’t think we can see with
one, and Mr. Charteris here. Have you
not got tea yet, Agnes? Nonsense,
what made you wait for me? I can’t
always be home at your hours, you know—when
a man hasn’t his time at his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
disposal, you know, Mr. Charteris—what
is it now?—what do you want,
Lettie?”</p>

<p>The solitary candle had been lighted,
and placed on the table. It threw a
painful illumination upon Harry’s perfectly
colourless face, as he stood in the
middle of the room, with an unsteady
swing in his movements. Agnes had
left the arm-chair to him, but still he
stood by the table—while Rose, with a
paleness almost as great as his upon her
face, went about painfully arranging
things that needed no arrangement, and
Martha sat rigid in her chair.</p>

<p>“I say, what is it, Lettie?” repeated
Harry.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Harry—only you’ve torn
your coat,” said Violet.</p>

<p>She showed it to him—some one had
seized his skirt apparently, to detain him,
and a great rent was visible. It brought
a sudden flush to the damp face of poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Harry, but the flush was of defiance and
anger. He struck Violet with his open
hand, and exclaimed impatiently, “Get
away, what business have <i>you</i> with that?”</p>

<p>It was a very slight blow—and Violet
shrank away in silence out of the room;
but a deep red burning colour flushed over
Martha’s faded face, and with a quick impulsive
start, she rose from her chair.</p>

<p>“Harry!” Her harsh hoarse voice
seemed to sober the unhappy lad. He
looked round him for a moment on those
other pale faces, and on the grieved and
embarrassed Cuthbert, with the defiant
stare which he had tried to maintain
before; but as his eyes turned to Martha,
and to the deep and painful colour of
shame and anguish on her face, poor
Harry’s courage fell. He did not speak—he
glided into the vacant chair, and
suddenly abandoning his poor design of
concealment covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<p>“Harry is not well—he is not strong
poor fellow,” said Agnes almost sobbing,
“get a cup of tea for him, Rose. Martha,
sit down.”</p>

<p>Martha obeyed mechanically. There
was a struggle in the face of poor Harry’s
passionate sister. The fierce impatience
of her anger seemed melting away—melting
into that utter despondency and hopelessness—that
deep humiliation, which
with the second sight that sometimes adds
new pangs to sorrow, saw that to hope
was useless, and yet in the depths did
only cling the closer to this impossible
hope. Poor Harry! Martha was not
given to weeping, but then she could have
wept—such desperate burning tears, as
only come out of the depths.</p>

<p>Cuthbert felt that if he had helped to
increase their pain by being a spectator of
this scene, he would but add to it by
hastening immediately away.</p>

<p>“I shall have a long walk,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
with forced ease, “and I think I must now
crave your last message for Ayr, Miss
Muir. What am I to say to your
uncle?”</p>

<p>“That you left us—Nay,” said Martha,
restraining herself with a great effort, and
glancing over to Harry with a strange
yearning look of grief, “say little to the
old man, Mr. Charteris. He knows how
he would wish us to be in his own gentle
heart—and it is best to leave it so; say
we were well—and now we must not detain
you. Harry, have you anything to
say to my uncle?”</p>

<p>Poor Harry uncovered his white unhappy
face. “I?—nothing—nothing—you
know I have nothing to say—good
bye, Mr. Charteris.”</p>

<p>“It is so short a time since we left Ayr,”
said Agnes, offering Cuthbert her trembling
hand.</p>

<p>And then he left the room.</p>

<p>The lobby was quite dark. Cuthbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
fancied he heard some sound like a suppressed
sob as Rose stole out after him,
and closed the parlour door. It was
Violet sitting in gloom and solitude on
the ground, with her little desolate heart
well nigh bursting. Martha had been
displeased at her. Harry had struck her—and
fearful dreams of being utterly
alone, and having no one in the world to
care for her, were passing drearily through
Violet’s mind. That sad dumb anguish
of the child, which we do not seem ever
to remember when we have children to
deal with, weighed down the young spirit
to the very dust. She thought, poor
solitary girl, miserable proud thoughts of
dying, and leaving them to grieve for her
when she was dead, who would not care
for her enough when she was living—and
she thought, too, of toiling on alone to
the vague greatness which children dream
of, and shutting up her heart in her solitary
course, from those who had chilled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and rejected it so early. Poor little
dreaming inconsistent poetic child, who
in an hour could be bright as the sunshine
again—but while it lasted there were
few things in elder life so bitter as that
childish pain.</p>

<p>Rose lifted her up and followed Charteris
to the door, holding the weeping and reluctant
Violet within her arm. “Mr.
Charteris,” said Rose, eagerly, “do not say
anything to my uncle about——. I mean,
will you just tell him we are well, and not
say that anything ails Harry? Will you,
Mr. Charteris?”</p>

<p>Cuthbert did not quite know what he
answered, neither did Rose; but whatever
it was it cheered her; and as he went
away, the youthful woman lingered in the
darkness, stooping over the child. Rose
had reached a further stage than Violet in
this grave journey of life; and if she knew
more fully the absolute causes of the family
affliction, she had outgrown the indefinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
gloom and terror. Other thoughts, too,
came in to lighten, in some degree, the
heaviness of her own heart, as she soothed
and consoled her little sister. Harry
hitherto had been constantly the central
object in her mind—the dearest always,
and in his brightest times the best—perhaps
only the more endeared for all his
weakness; but now there began to dawn
upon Rose a stronger, purer, higher ideal.
Stealthy and tremulous the thought glided
into her mind; a higher excellence than
poor Harry’s—a fairer fate than that of
Harry’s sister. She put it away as if it
had been guilt; but still it had looked in
upon her, and left a trace of secret sunshine
behind.</p>

<p>Thus they were, the child and the girl—Violet
already cheered by the gentle
voice of Rose, and Rose lightened with
the fair fantastic light of her own thick-coming
fancies. Neither forgot the sorrow
which was parted from them only by these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
slight walls—neither yet could stay their
involuntary tears—and the elder heart
overflowed with pity and tenderness for
poor Harry; but yet there were others
than Harry in the world for both.</p>

<p>Within that little room it was far otherwise.
He was sitting there still, his
clasped hands covering his face, and the
cup of tea, which Agnes had poured out
for him, standing untasted on the table.
No one else had thought of beginning to
this joyless meal. Agnes sat near him,
leaning her arm upon his chair, touching
his shoulder sometimes, and murmuring
“Harry;” but he had not lifted his head.
Opposite him, Martha sat very still, her
eyes wandering about, her fingers convulsively
clasped, her features moving. Sometimes
she started suddenly, as if she could
have dashed that aching brow of hers
against the wall; sometimes a low unconscious
moan escaped from her lips; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
when, after wandering round the room,
noting the little well-known peculiarities
of its furniture, as people only do in their
bitterest moments, her eyes turned to
Harry lying motionless in his chair, with
the damp hair clustering upon his brow,
and his hands hiding his face, the anger
and passion fled away from her brow like
shadows. Poor Harry! in his weakness,
in his sin—only so much the more her
own—not the strong man now, for whom
she had woven dreams of fond and proud
ambition—but ever and always the dependent
boy, the child she tended long ago—the
unhappy lad over whom her heart
yearned now as a mother. Martha rose—the
tears came out from under her dry
eyelids—a sad smile dawned upon the
stern harsh features of her face. She laid
her hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Harry, Harry, is it worth all this
misery? We have nothing but you—no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
hope in this world but you. Will you
take it from us, Harry? Will you make
us desolate?”</p>

<p>The little wife looked up through her
tears, begging forbearance. Poor Harry
himself lifted his head, and grasped the
hands she held out to him. “Never again—never
again.”</p>

<p>Her tears fell upon the clasped hands,
and so did his. “Never again.” Violet
crept to his side, and softly laid her little
hand upon his arm. Agnes, weeping
quietly, rested her head upon his shoulder,
almost happy again in the reconciliation;
and Rose stood behind his chair.</p>

<p>Poor Harry! They all heard his vow;
they all tried to take up their hope, and
once more look fearlessly on the future.
No one believed more devoutly than he
did himself that now he could not fall
again. No one was so confident as he
that this sin was his last: “Never again.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Heavy, unseen tears flowed from under
Martha’s closed eyelids that night, when
all the rest were peacefully asleep—poor
Harry first of all. Never again! The
words moved her to anything but hope.
Poor Harry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning very early, while
Martha Muir, unable to rest, sat at the
window, carefully mending the torn coat
which was poor Harry’s only one, Cuthbert
Charteris set out on the top of the
coach for Ayr. What he had seen on the
previous night oppressed him heavily,
weighing down even the natural exhilaration
which the morning sunshine usually
brought to a mind void of offence towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
men, and walking by faith humbly with
God. Continually that scene rose up
before him—the hidden tears and trembling
of Agnes and Rose—the stern agitation
of Martha—the fatuous smile
upon poor Harry’s white conscious face.
“Poor Harry!” the stranger echoed with
emotion, the sad tenderness of this lamentation
so familiar to Harry’s nearest
friends.</p>

<p>Harry, meanwhile, was peacefully asleep,
unconscious of the hopeless musing of his
sister, as she sat by the window not long
after sunrise, doing this sad piece of
work for him, and of the gloom which
he cast over the happier mind of his
friend; a common case—almost too common
to need recording.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon before Charteris
left his inn to seek the house of Alexander
Muir. In the intermediate time
he had been wandering about the town,
and hunting through one old churchyard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
which lay in his way for the graves of the
Allenders; but his search was not successful.
The afternoon was bright and warm, the
month being now far advanced, and he
was directed easily to the residence of the
old man whom everybody seemed to
know. It was in one of the quiet back
streets of the town, a narrow-causewayed
lane, kept in a kind of constant twilight
by the shadows of tall houses. The
house he sought was not tall—its low door
opened immediately from the rough stones
of the street; and on either side was a
square window fortified with strong panes
of greenish glass, which gave a hue by no
means delightful to the little checked-muslin
blinds within. The upper story
was a separate house, and had an outside
stair ascending to it, which stair darkened
the lower door, and served as a sort of
porch, supported on the further side by a
rude pillar of mason-work. Cuthbert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
thought it a very dim dusky habitation
for the gentle uncle of the Muirs.</p>

<p>A little maid-servant, with a striped
red and black woollen petticoat and “short
gown” of bright printed cotton, opened
the door for him. Descending a single
step, Cuthbert entered a narrow passage,
at the end of which was another open
door, with a bright prospect of trees and
flowers, and sunshine beyond. The lobby
was paved with brick, very red and clean,
which the little servant seemed just to
have finished scouring; and an open door
on one side of it gave him a glimpse of a
trim bed-chamber, with flowers on its
little dressing-table; on the other side
was another door (closed) of another bed-room;
and, looking to the garden, the
kitchen and the little parlour occupied the
further side of the house.</p>

<p>“Will ye just gang in, sir,” said the
girl, removing her pail out of Cuthbert’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
way; “ye’ll get him in the garden himsel.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert obeyed, and passed by himself
to the other door.</p>

<p>A very singular scene awaited him
there. The garden was a large one, and
formed the greatest possible contrast to
the dusky front of the house. Apple
trees in full blossom, and a bright congregation
of all the flowers of spring, surrounded
the more homely produce in
which the large enclosure seemed rich.
The door was matted round with climbing
plants, roses, and honey-suckles, which, in
a month or two, would be as bright and
fragrant as now they were green; and a
splendid pear-tree, flushed with blossom,
covered one entire side of the house.</p>

<p>But the animate part of the picture was
still more remarkable—scattered through
the garden in groups, but principally here
near the door where some fine trees sheltered,
and the sun shone upon them, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
a number of girls, from fourteen to twenty,
working the Ayrshire work as it is called—to
wit, the fine embroideries on muslin,
which the Muirs “opened”—and talking,
as girls generally talk, very happily and
gaily—with snatches of song, and pleasant
laughter. They had all the average good
looks, and were dressed becomingly, as
girls in their class, who maintain themselves
by needlework, generally are. Completely
astonished at first, Cuthbert became
amused and interested in the scene
as he stood a moment unperceived at the
door, especially when, through the embowering
leaves, he caught a glimpse of
the person he had come to see.</p>

<p>He was a little spare man, with hair
nearly white, and a hale ruddy cheek.
Seated in an arm-chair, in front of his
parlour window, with a book in his hand,
it was very evident that the good man’s
book had very little share of his attention.
At present he was telling a story to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
audience; and Cuthbert admired the
natural eloquence, the simple grace of
language, in which he clothed it. His
speech was quite Scottish, and even a
little provincial, but untainted with the
least mixture of vulgarity; and when he
had rounded his tale with a quotation
from Burns, he opened the book in which
he had been keeping his place with his
finger, only to close it again immediately,
when a new demand was made upon his
attention.</p>

<p>“Eh, Mr. Muir,” said one of the girls,
“what for have ye such lots of horse-gowans
yonder in the corner?”</p>

<p>“They’re no horse-gowans, Beatie, my
woman—they’re camomile,” said the old
man.</p>

<p>“And what is’t for? is it for eating?”
asked the curious Beatie.</p>

<p>“It’s for making drinks for no weel
folk,” volunteered a better-informed companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>“It’s for selling to John Wilson, the
man that has taken up physic at his own
hand,” said the chairman of this strange
assembly. “They tell me he’s a friend of
Dr. Hornbook’s; you’ve all read of Dr.
Hornbook in Burns.”</p>

<p>There was a general assent; but some,
among whom was the Beatie aforesaid,
looked wistful and curious, and had not
heard of that eminent personage.</p>

<p>“It’s a profane thing, a profane thing,”
said Alexander Muir. “Keep to the Cottar,
like good bairns. Ye’ll get no ill out of it.
But what ails ye, Beatie, my woman?”</p>

<p>“Eh, sir, it’s a gentleman,” said Beatie,
under her breath. Whereupon there ensued
a dead silence, and a fit of spasmodic
industry came upon the girls, occasionally
interrupted by a smothered titter, as one
of the more mischievous, who sat with her
back to the door, tempted to laughter her
companions, whose downcast faces were
towards the stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

<p>Cuthbert introduced himself in a few
words, and was heartily greeted by the
old man. “I have an obligation to you,
sir, as well as the rest of them, for your
care of Harry,” said the uncle; “and ye
left them well? They are my family,
these bairns, an old solitary man as I
am, and their friends are most welcome to
me.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have another family
round you here,” said Cuthbert, looking
with a smile on the demure group before
him, some of whom were painfully suppressing
the laugh which they could not
altogether conceal.</p>

<p>“Neighbours’ bairns,” said Alexander
Muir; “bits of innocent things that have
not the freedom of a garden like mine at
home. There is a kind of natural kin
between them and the spring. I like to
see them among my flowers, and I think
their work gets on all the better, that
they are cheery in the doing of it; but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
tell you the truth, I cannot see, Mr. Charteris,
how our own bairns should think
themselves better in Glasgow than with
me, now that Harry has gotten a wife.”</p>

<p>“They wish to remain together, I
fancy,” said Cuthbert, sadly remembering
the bitter tie which kept them beside poor
Harry; “but both for health and happiness,
Mr. Muir, I should fancy they would
be better with you.”</p>

<p>“Say you so?” said the old man, eagerly,
“for happiness; aye, say you so?”</p>

<p>Cuthbert hastened to explain away, so
far as he could, the painful meaning of
his words, leaving it to be inferred that
it was only the fresh air and freedom of
this pleasant place, of which they stood in
need.</p>

<p>“I am going in for a while with this
gentleman,” said uncle Sandy, raising his
voice as he turned to his little congregation;
“but mind there is no need for
you turning idle because I am not here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to look after you; mind and be eident, as
the cotter’s bairns were bidden to be.”</p>

<p>The girls acknowledged the smiling
speech addressed to them by great demonstration
of industry, and for a few minutes
the blue stamped leaves and branches of
their muslin grew into white embroidery
with wonderful speed. The old man
looked round upon them with a smile, as
they sat bending down their heads under
the glistening sunshine over their pretty
work, and then, laying his book on his
chair, he led the way into the house.</p>

<p>The parlour was a very small one, considerably
less than the best bed-room,
which occupied the front of the house,
and which, by an occupant of less poetic
taste, would have been made the sitting-room.
But Alexander Muir did not like
the dull prospect of the little back street;
he preferred to look out upon the garden
in which so much of his time was spent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
and the little room was large enough for all
his quiet necessities.</p>

<p>His old easy chair had been removed
from the fireside corner to the window. It
was a latticed window, furnished with a
broad shelf extending all the length of its
deep recess, which seemed to have been
made for plants—but no plants interposed
themselves between the sun-shine and the
books, which were the best beloved companions
of the old, gentle, solitary man.
Cuthbert looked at them as they lay in
little heaps in the corner of the window.
There was no dust about them, but almost
as little arrangement. They lay, as their
contents lay in the head of their good
master, mingled in pleasant friendliness.
The Fourfold State and the Crook in the
Lot embraced the royal sides of Shakspere,
and a much-used copy of Burns lay peacefully
beside the Milton, which, to tell
truth, opened more easily at Comus or at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Il Penseroso than in either Paradise. Besides
these there were Cowper and Young,
an odd volume of the Spectator, an old
time-worn copy of the Pilgrim, with
Samuel Rutherford’s Letters, and Fleming,
the interpreter of prophecy, and the quaint
Willison ballasting some volumes of Scott
and Galt. Daily friends and comrades
were these, bearing marks of long and
frequent use, some of them encased in
homely covers of green cloth, which the
old man’s own careful hands had endued
them with; some half bound, after his
fashion, with stripes of uncultivated “calf”
defending their backs, and their boards
gay with marbled paper. It was pleasant
to see them, in their disarrangement, upon
the broad ledge of the window, friends too
intimate and familiar to be kept on ceremonious
terms.</p>

<p>“Take a seat, Mr. Charteris,” said uncle
Sandy; “if you had come while Harry was
here it might have been pleasanter for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
you—for Harry, poor man, is a blithe
companion; maybe over blithe sometimes
for his own well-doing: And you think
the bairns would be better with me?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Charteris, hastily, “except
in so far as this house of yours, Mr. Muir,
is certainly a most pleasant contrast to
the din and haste of Glasgow, and your
nieces, you know, like your young friends
yonder, are of kin to spring.”</p>

<p>The old man had seated himself in his
easy chair, which Cuthbert would not
take. He took off his spectacles to wipe
them with his handkerchief, and shook
his head. “There is Rose, to be sure, and
little Lettie; but my niece, Martha, Mr.
Charteris—well, I cannot tell—the spring
may come to her yet after the summer
has passed. I would not put the bondage
of common use about Martha, for the like
of me is little able to judge the like of her.
It is a hard thing to understand. It
might have been a question in the days of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the auld philosophy—what for the mind
that would have served a conqueror should
be put into her—a mind that can ill bow
to the present yoke—when there is even
too much need of such in high places. It
will be clear enough some time—but it has
aye been a wonder to me.”</p>

<p>“There may be difficulties in her way
to conquer, more hopeless than kingdoms,”
said Cuthbert involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Young man, do you ken of any evil
tidings,” asked Alexander Muir, with sudden
haste and energy.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” said Cuthbert,
annoyed at himself for speaking words
from which inferences so painful could be
drawn—“You must hear my special mission
to Ayr, Mr. Muir. Your niece has
told me that the name of her grandmother
was Allenders—it is an unusual name—Could
you give me any information about
the family.”</p>

<p>The old man looked considerably surprised.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
“They were strangers here,” he
said. “I mind of Mrs. Calder, very well,
whose daughter Violet married James
Muir, my brother. He was ten years
younger than me, and so I mind of his
good-mother, though she died long ago.
They came from London, Mr. Charteris.
There was a father and two daughters in
the family. I will let you see all that remains
of them—their grave.”</p>

<p>“And are there no papers—no way of
tracing the family to their origin,” said
Cuthbert, with some uneasiness.</p>

<p>“We have never thought it of any importance,”
said the old man, smiling, “if
it is, we may fall on some means maybe.
It sharpens folk’s wits to have something
to find out—but what depends on it, Mr.
Charteris.”</p>

<p>“I have said nothing of it to our friends
in Glasgow—fearing that the name might
have misled me,” said Cuthbert, “but
there is, I am glad to tell you, an estate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
depending upon it—not a great one, Mr.
Muir—a comfortable small estate producing
some four hundred pounds a-year.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert wanted to be rather under
than over the mark—four hundred pounds
a-year! the sum was princely and magnificent
to the astonished old man. He
looked at Cuthbert in a mist of bewilderment.
He took off his spectacles and
wiped their glasses again. He put up his
hand to his head, and rubbed his forehead
in confused amazement. “Four hundred
pounds a-year!”</p>

<p>“So far as I have gone yet, it seems
almost certain that your nephew is the
heir,” said Cuthbert. “The surname of
itself is much, and the Christian names
confirm its evidence very strongly. If
you think there can be anything done to
trace the origin of these Allenders, I should
be glad to proceed to it at once.”</p>

<p>The old man had bowed down his head—he
was fumbling now with nerveless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
fingers at his glasses, and suddenly he
raised the handkerchief with which he
had been wiping them, up to his eyes.
Some sounds, Cuthbert heard, like one or
two broken irrepressible sobs, “For Harry—for
the unstable callant—the Lord’s
grace to save him from temptation—that
I should live to see this hope!”</p>

<p>The short broken sobs continued for a
moment, and then he raised his head. “I
see, Sir,” said the old man, with natural
dignity, “that to thank you for troubling
yourself in this way, with the humble
concerns of these orphans, who can render
you little in return, would be to hold you
in less esteem than is your due. I take
your service, as, if I had been as young
and well endowed as you, I think I could
maybe have rendered it—and now tell
me what it is you want to discover—that
I may further it, if I can, without delay.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> in Lindsay’s words, Cuthbert
told to the old man the story of the Allenders.
He listened without making any
remark, but evidently, as Cuthbert saw,
with great attention.</p>

<p>“John Allenders—yes, that was the
name,” he said, when his visitor had concluded.
“And Violet and Rose—it looks
like—very like, as if these bairns were the
folk you seek. I pray heaven they may;
no for the siller,” continued the old
man, turning back on his way to the pin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
where hung his low broad-brimmed hat:
“no alone or even specially for the siller;
but for other matters, Mr. Charteris—other
things of more concern to Martha and me,
and the rest of them, too, poor things,
than silver and gold; though no doubt an
honourable maintenance, no to say a
grand independence like that, is to be
thankfully received for itself, if we would
not sin our mercies—and now, sir, I am
ready.”</p>

<p>Charteris followed without any question.</p>

<p>The old man turned first to the garden
door, and looked out. His young guests
had slackened a little in their industry;
one of them sat solemnly in the arm-chair,
reading with great emphasis from the
book he had left. Another had thrown
down her work to arrange in elaborate
braids a favourite companion’s hair; and
two or three other groups, with their
heads close together, were discussing “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
gentleman;” and what could possibly be
his errand with Maister <i>Meur</i>. “Bairns,”
said the old man, looking out smilingly.
With a sudden start the girls resumed
their work, the occupant of the arm-chair
threw down the book in great haste, and
fled to her own seat.</p>

<p>“The book will do ye no harm; ye
may read it out loud, one at a time,” said
the gracious patron of the young embroiderers;
“but see that you do not forget
what work must be done, or make me forsworn
of my word, when I promised to
see ye keep from idleness. Mind! or we
will cast out the morn.”</p>

<p>Saying which, the old man turned to
the street door, directing his little Jessie
as he passed the kitchen, to have tea prepared
with some ornamental additions to
its ordinary bread and butter, which he
specified in a whisper, exactly at six
o’clock.</p>

<p>“And I have a spare room that you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
most kindly welcome to, if ye can put up
with my small accommodations, Mr. Charteris,”
said the master of the little house,
as they passed into the street; “but I see
you are for asking where we are to go.
There is one person in the town that may
very likely help us, I think. She was
aunt to my sister-in-law, that’s now departed,
and knew all about the Allenders.
She is an old woman. I would not say,
but she has the better of me by twenty
years; but she’s sharper at worldly business
yet, than many folk in their prime.
She has some bits of property and money
saved that will come to the bairns no
doubt some time, but the now she holds
a firm grip, and is jealous of respect on
the head of it. I will take it kind if ye
will just grant her the bit little ceremony
that has grown a necessity to her, Mr.
Charteris. She is an aged woman, and it
does not set youth ill to honour even the
whims of gray hairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be very careful,” said Cuthbert
with a smile, for he did not think it
needful to add that he was a very unlikely
person to show any want of courtesy to
the aged or the weak.</p>

<p>They walked through the town somewhat
slowly, for the old man paused now and
then to point out with genuine pride and
affection the notable things they passed.
The polemic Brigs, the Wallace tower.
His mild gray eye kindled as he reminded
his visitor that this was doubly classic
ground—the land of Wallace, and of
Burns—of the old traditional hero whose
mighty form looms over his country still,
and of the unhappy poet whom the poor
of Scotland cherish in their hearts.</p>

<p>Alexander Muir was one of those whose
end of life seems almost as pure as its
beginning. A spirit so blameless and
placid, that we might almost think it had
only been sent here, because it is a greater
joy to be a man, and know by certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
experiment the wonderful mystery of redemption,
than to be satisfied with such
knowledge as the sinless in heaven can
gain. It is happy for us, amid the dark
records of common lives, that here and
there God permits us one such man, born
to be purer than his fellows; so much
lower than the angels that the taint of
native sin has come with him into the
world—so much higher than they, that
the mantle of the Lord has fallen upon
him, and that he stands accepted in a
holiness achieved by the Master and King
of all. Lichened over with the moss of
age, in quiet places here and there five
gracious souls of this happy class, and
Alexander Muir was one.</p>

<p>But very human was the pure unworldly
spirit, deeply learned in the antiquities
of the country, with which his very life
seemed woven. Happily proud of all its
fame and all its great men, and interested
even in its prejudices, there could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
been found nowhere a guide more pleasant.
Cuthbert and he insensibly began to use
the language of intimates—to feel themselves
old friends; and when the children
in the streets came forward to pull the old
man’s skirts, and solicit his notice, the
young one, impatient at first of the delay,
became soon so much interested in the
universal acquaintanceship of his cheerful
companion, as to linger well pleased where
he chose to linger. Almost every one
who met them had a recognition respectful
and kindly for uncle Sandy. His
passage through the street was a progress.</p>

<p>“But we are putting off our time,”
said uncle Sandy at last. “This way,
Mr. Charteris.”</p>

<p>They were then in the outskirts of the
town; before a two story house, of smaller
proportions than his own, the old man at
last concluded his walk. The door stood
open, and the sanded passage leading to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
flight of stone stairs, floury and white with
“camstane,” proclaimed the house to have
more occupants than one. A door opening
into this passage gave them a glimpse of a
family apartment, where the mother stood
at an ample tub washing, while children
of all sizes overflowed the limits of the
moderately clean kitchen. This woman,
Mr. Muir addressed kindly, inquiring after
her exuberant family first, and then for
Miss Jean.</p>

<p>“Ou ay, there’s naething ails her,” was
the answer, given not without some seeming
ill-humour. “I was paying her the
rent yestreen. She’s glegger about siller
now, than ever I was a’ my days; and as
for gieing a bawbee to a wean, or an hour’s
mercy to a puir body, ye micht as weel
move the heart o’ a whinstane; no that
we’re needing ony o’ her charity. I have
a guid man to work for me, that has been
even on seven year wi’ ae maister, and
there’s no mony could say that; but it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
awfu’ to see an auld body wi’ such a grip
o’ the world.”</p>

<p>Leaving Miss Jean’s tenant, operating
with angry energy upon the garments in
her hands, they proceeded up the camstaned
stair to the door of Miss Jean’s
own habitation. A very small girl, dressed
in a remote and far-away fashion, with a
thick cap covering her short-cut hair, admitted
them, recognising the old man with
a smile of evident pleasure, and looking
with a little alarm at his companion.</p>

<p>“You will tell Miss Jean it’s me, Katie,
and a stranger gentleman I’ve brought to
see her,” said uncle Sandy; “and when is
she to let you home to see your mother?”</p>

<p>“Whisht,” said the little girl in a
whisper; “she’ll hear. She’ll no let me
at a’. Oh, if you would speak to her,
uncle!”</p>

<p>“So I will, Katie, my woman,” said the
old man kindly, patting the head of the
little drudge as she showed them into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
front room; “and mind you and be a good
bairn in the mean time, and dinna be ill
to her, even if she is ill to you: and now
you must tell Miss Jean.”</p>

<p>The child fingered a moment. “If ye
please, uncle—maybe she’ll no let me speak
to you after—is Lettie ever coming back
again?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, my dear; there’s no saying,”
said uncle Sandy. “I will try if she can
come to see you, or maybe I will take you
to see her; but, Katie, my woman, you
must tell Miss Jean.”</p>

<p>The little girl went away with a lighter
step. “She is a faraway cousin,” said
the old man, “a fatherless bairn, poor
thing, needing whiles to eat bitter bread;
if our bairns come to their kingdom they
must take Katie Calder. I think the
blood is warmer on our side of the house;
any way none of them will grudge the bit
lassie her upbringing.”</p>

<p>Miss Jean Calder’s best room was furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
with a set of old lugubrious mahogany
chairs, and a solemn four-posted
bedstead, with terrible curtains of heavy
dark moreen. Neither the bed nor the
room were ever used, the other apartment
serving all purposes of kitchen, parlour,
and sleeping-room to its aged mistress
and her little handmaiden. They could
hear sounds of some little commotion in
it, as they sat down to wait. Miss Jean
had preparations to make before she could
receive visitors.</p>

<p>At last, having completed these, she
entered the room. She was a tall and
very meagre old woman, with very false
black hair smoothed over the ashy wrinkled
brow of extreme age, and a dirty cap of
white net, hastily substituted for the flannel
one in which she had been sitting by the
fireside in the other room; an old, dingy,
much-worn shawl and a rustling black silk
apron covered the short-comings of her
dress; but underneath the puckers of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
eye-lids, keen, sharp, frosty eyes of blue
looked out with undiminished vision; and,
but for the pinched and grasping expression
which seemed to have settled down
upon them, there would have been intelligence
still in the withered features, which
once, too, had had their share of beauty.
Some one says prettily that Nature, in
learning to make the lily, turned out the
<span class ="err" title="original: convolvolus">convolvulus</span>. One may trace something
like this in the character of a family as it
descends from one generation to another,
as if, the idea of a peculiar creation once
taken up, experiments were made upon
the race, and gradations of the mind to be
produced, were thrown, first into one position
and then another, until the climax
was put upon them all by the one commanding
spirit in which the design was
perfected. It is not uncommon. Miss
Jean Calder was a lesser and narrower
example of the mind of Martha Muir;
eager in her young days to raise herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
above her comrades, she had repelled with
disdain the neighbours’ sons, who admired
her; while yet she resented bitterly the
neglect with which her honest wooers
avenged themselves afterwards for her disdain.
Then the selfish, fiery, proud woman
began with firm industry to make a permanent
provision for herself; and from
that early period until about two years
before this time, she had toiled early
and late, like the poorest of labouring
men. All that might have been generous
and lofty—if there ever was such admixture
in the ambition and pride of her
youth—had evaporated long ago; a tyrant
of unbending will in her small dominion—a
hard, grasping, pitiless creditor to the
miserable tenants who happened to be in
her power—an unhappy spirit, clinging to
the saddest dross of worldliness, she had
become.</p>

<p>A sad object—but yet standing, to the
mind of Martha Muir—if we may venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
so to speak of the working of Him who
creates all—in the relation of a study to a
great painting—a model to a finished
statue.</p>

<p>“Good morning to ye, Alexander Muir,”
said Miss Jean, “who’s this ye’ve brought
in your hand?”</p>

<p>“The gentleman is from Edinburgh,
Miss Jean,” said Alexander. “He is a
friend of Harry’s, and has been kind to
him, as most folk are, indeed, who ken the
lad.”</p>

<p>“I tell ye, Sandy, ye have made a fuil
of that boy,” said the old woman harshly;
“a wasterful spendthrift lad that would
throw away every bawbee that he had, and
mair, that he hasna; but he needna look
to sorn on me if ever he comes to want.
I have nae mair than I can do wi’ mysel:
and where’s my twenty shillings, guid
white monie, that I gied to fit him out?”</p>

<p>“He will pay it back some day, no
fear,” said Alexander, “for I hear from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
this gentleman that Harry is like to
prosper, poor man, and no doubt he will
mind his friends, Miss Jean. The gentleman
has been speaking to me of your
guid sister, John Calder’s wife. He thinks
he kens some good friends she had. Did
you ever hear what part that family came
from?”</p>

<p>“Ay, good friends? where are they?
what’s like to come o’t?” said Miss Jean,
fixing the frosty eyes, whose keen light
contrasted so strangely with her ashy
wrinkled face, on Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell,” said Cuthbert, warily,
“it depends entirely upon what relationship
I may discover—but it may be good
for those who were kind to the Allenders,
Miss Calder, if I find that they were relatives
of the family I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Kind to the Allenders? Do you ken,
lad, that it was <i>my</i> mother took them in,
when their father died, and the poor things
hadna a mortal to look after them?—kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
to the Allenders, said he?—weel, weel—puir
bairns, they’re baith gane.”</p>

<p>Something human crossed the sharp
pinched selfish face—even in this degraded
spirit, there was a memory of the fragrant
far away youth.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Charteris,” said Alexander
Muir, “would like to ken where they
came from, Miss Jean—it is weel kent
how good ye were to the orphans—I am
meaning your mother—and no doubt you
ken better about them than indifferent
folk;—that was the way I troubled you,
and brought Mr. Charteris this length.”</p>

<p>“Wha’s Mr. Charteris?”</p>

<p>“It’s the gentleman,” said the old man
simply.</p>

<p>“If they left any papers,” interposed
Cuthbert, “or books, or any relics indeed
from which we might discover their origin—I
should feel it a great obligation, Miss
Calder, if you would assist me to trace
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<p>“Obligation! I have little broo of obligation,”
said the old woman with a
grating laugh, mingled of harshness
and imbecility. “I have seen ower
mony folk that I obliged, slip away out
of my hand like a knotless thread; but
is there anything like to come of it? I
dinna ken this stranger lad—I can put
trust in you, Alexander Muir—that is in
what you <i>say</i>, ye ken.”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Jean, it depends upon
what the gentleman finds out,” said the
old man, a little proud of his tactics, and
marvelling within himself at his own address,
“if he can be satisfied by means of
any papers or books or such like—I believe
something good may come of it.”</p>

<p>The old woman wavered. “It’s a
hantle trouble,” she said, “to put a frail
woman like me to, that have but a little
monkey of a lassie to help me in the
house,—but there <i>is</i> a kist ben yonder in
below the bed—and there may be some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
bits of things in it—I dinna ken—but
neither her nor me are fit to pull it out.”</p>

<p>“Can I help?” said Cuthbert, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Ye’re unco ready wi’ your offer, lad,”
said Miss Jean, grimly, “it’s no for love
o’ the wark, I judge, wi’ thae bit white
lassie’s fingers—look at mine,” and she
extended a long shrivelled hand, armed
like the claws of a bird, “na, na, I ken
naething about you—but if Katie and you
can manage it, Sandy Muir—and she’s a
fusionless brat, no worth the half of the
meat she eats—I’ll be nae hindrance—ye
can try.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Oh, lean and covetous old age!—a winter unblessed,
that blights where’er it touches.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Muir</span> instantly proceeded
in great haste to the kitchen, whither
Miss Jean suspiciously followed him. In
a few minutes Cuthbert heard “the kist”
making audible progress—and a very short
time after, the old man called him out to
the passage, between the two rooms,
whither they had dragged it.</p>

<p>“Ye’re giving yoursel a hantle fash
wi’ a thing that can never do you ony
good, Sandy,” said Miss Jean tauntingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
“for the Allenders were nae connexion to
you, even though Violet Calder did marry
your brother Jamie—Weel I wat she
would have been better wanting him. It’s
a bonnie story when its telled—a woman
to live as lang as fifty year, and syne to
die because her man died—auld taupie!
when she might have been to the fore to
have a share of the benefit, if there is to
be ony benefit—what ailed the fuil to
dee?”</p>

<p>“Poor woman, she would have been
blithe to remain, for the bairns’ sakes,”
said the old man, gently, “if it had not
been otherwise ordained.”</p>

<p>“Weel, there’s the fewer to pairt it
among, if onything comes o’ this,” said
the miser. “Ye maun just stand back
awee, my man. I dinna open a’ my
posies afore fremd folk; and ye’re no to
think the Allenders left as muckle behind
them, claithes and a’ thegither, as would
fill the half o’ that kist. What there is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
I’ll bring ye, but I’ll hae nae stranger
meddling wi’ my gear.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert withdrew as he was ordered,
to the door of the “best room.” The
chest was a large one, painted a dull brown
colour, and judging from its broken lock,
contained nothing of any value. The old
woman raised the lid, and dived into a
wilderness of lumber, faded worn out
cobweb-like garments, long ago unfit for
use, but preserved nevertheless on the
penurious principle of throwing nothing
away. After long fishing among these
relics of ancient finery, Miss Jean at last
produced from the very bottom of the
abyss, a small quarto Bible in a dark decayed
binding, much worn at the corners.
“Here!” she said, abruptly, handing it to
Cuthbert, “ye can look at that, and I’ll
see if there’s ony mair—there should be
some papers in the shottle.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert hastily returned to the window
to examine the book; on the fly leaf was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
written simply the name of John Allenders,
a remote date, and a text. It gave
no further clue to its owner’s identity.</p>

<p>“Have ye gotten onything, Mr. Charteris?”
asked anxiously the old man at
his side. Cuthbert could only shake his
head as he turned over the dark old pages
and looked for farther information in
vain.</p>

<p>The Bible contained, as all Bibles do in
Scotland, the metrical version of psalms
sanctioned by the Kirk, and between the
end of the New Testament and the beginning
of these, it is customary to have the
family register of births and deaths.
Cuthbert turned hastily to this place; at
first he concluded there was no entry, but
on further examination, he found that two
leaves had been pasted together, and that
on the outer side of one something was
written. He looked at it, “Behold, I
take away from thee the desire of thine
eyes with a stroke,” was the melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
inscription; and the handwriting was stiff
and painful and elaborate, most like the
hand of bitter grief. There were mistakes
too and slips of the mournful pen. Cuthbert
felt it move him greatly—so strange
it seemed to see the mark of the faltering
hasty fingers, which so long ago were at
rest for ever.</p>

<p>One of the leaves had been a good deal
torn in a vain endeavour to open this
sealed record. Cuthbert feeling himself
growing excited and anxious, with the
wished for evidence so very near him, made
other attempts which were as unsuccessful.
The dead man had shut up the chronicle
of his happier days that he might not see
it in his desolation, and the jealous grief
seemed to linger about it as its guardian
still.</p>

<p>Cuthbert held it up to the light and
endeavoured to read through, but with as
little success as before. Alexander Muir
had been watching him anxiously. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
was a glass of water on the table, which
Katie had brought for him; the old man
wet his handkerchief, and with trembling
hands spread it upon the hidden page.</p>

<p>“I dinna ken what a’ thae papers are,”
said Miss Jean, entering with a bundle of
yellow letters tied together with a strip of
old linen as yellow as themselves, “but
there’s nae secrets in them, ye may look
over them as ye like. What are ye doin’
to the book?”</p>

<p>“There’s something written here,” said
the old man, endeavouring vainly to conceal
his anxiety.</p>

<p>“Ane wad think there was a fortune
coming to <i>you</i>, Sandy Muir,” said Miss
Jean, “ye’re unco anxious to bring profit
to other folk.”</p>

<p>“I aye wished weel to my neighbours,”
said Alexander, meekly, and with a little
self-reproach. He felt as if it were almost
selfish to be so anxious about his nephew’s
fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime Cuthbert untied the
string, and as the too jealous gum showed
yet no indication of yielding, began to look
over the papers. The first that came to
his hands, evidently added by Miss Jean
to the original heap, and ostentatiously
displayed on the top, was an account for
the funeral expenses of John Allenders, in
which Mrs. Calder appeared debtor to
William Lochhead, undertaker; unfortunately
Miss Jean had not observed the
rigid honesty with which it was endorsed
in a very cramped female hand, “Paid by
me, out of the notes left by John Allenders
for his burial, leaving a balance of three
pounds and a penny halfpenny for the
behoof of Rose and Violet. Signed—Marget
Calder.”</p>

<p>Other tantalizing bits of writing were
below this; a child’s note signed Violet,
and addressed to the father in some temporary
absence from home, telling how
Rose had began to “flower” a collar, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
how the writer herself had bought seeds
with her sixpence for Mrs. Calder’s garden.
Another bit of paper contained a list, in a
hand more formed, of different articles of
“flowering,” received from some warehouse.
Then there were school accounts,
for the girls, of a still earlier date, and at
last Cuthbert came to a letter bearing the
postmark of London and Stirling. He
opened it in haste. It was a letter of
commonplace condolence, beginning, “My
dear Sir,” and suggesting the ordinary
kind of consolation for the loss of “my
dear departed sister,” and was signed by
“Daniel Scott.” Lindsay had not mentioned
the surname of the wife of John
Allenders—this letter was evidently from
her brother.</p>

<p>Cuthbert went on with great anxiety,
and very considerable excitement, just
glancing up to see that the softening process
carried on by Alexander Muir had
not yet produced much effect, and taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
no part in the conversation. The next
letter in the bundle was in the same hand,
and in its substance little more interesting;
but its <span class ="err" title="original: postcript">postscript</span> brought a flush of
satisfaction to Cuthbert’s eager face.</p>

<p>“I hear that your father is but weakly,”
wrote the matter-of-fact Daniel, “and
your brother Gilbert being dead two
months ago, as you were informed, has
sent for Walter—that’s the captain—home.
If you were asking my opinion, I
would say you should certainly come back
to be at hand whatever might happen; for
when once trouble comes into a family,
there is no saying where it may end; and,
after your father, and Walter, and Robert,
there is no doubt that you are the right
heir.”</p>

<p>This letter had been torn up as if in
indignation of the cold-blooded counsel.
Cuthbert laid it aside as a link in the
chain which he had to form.</p>

<p>“I’ll no have the book destroyed wi’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
weet. I tell ye, I winna, Sandy Muir,”
said Miss Jean, extending her lean brown
hand. “Let it abee wi’ your napkin. I
wonder that the like o’ you, that pretends
to be better than your neighbours, could
gie such usage to the Scripture. Think
shame o’ yourself, man; and be done wi’
your slaistering.”</p>

<p>The old man thrust her hand away
with less than his usual mildness. “Have
patience a moment—just have patience.
See, Mr. Charteris, see!”</p>

<p>Cuthbert rose—the leaves came slowly
separate—and there in this simple record
was all he sought.</p>

<p>“John Allenders, writer, fourth son of
Gilbert Allenders, of Allenders, married,
on the first day of March, 1769, to Rose
Scott, daughter of Thomas Scott, builder,
Stirling.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert laid down the book on the
table, and, extending his hand, took the
somewhat reluctant one of the anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
old man, and shook it heartily. “It’s all
right,” said Cuthbert, swinging the arm
of uncle Sandy in unusual exhilaration.
“It’s all right. I have nothing to do but
congratulate you, and get up the proof.
I thought we would find it, and here it is
as clear as daylight. It’s all exactly as it
should be.”</p>

<p>“What is right? what’s the lad meaning?”
said Miss Jean, thrusting herself in
between them; “and what are ye shaking
hands wi’ that foolish body Sandy Muir
for, when it’s me that ony thing belonging
to the Allenders should justly come to?
We keepit them here in our ain house;
we gied the auld man decent burial as ye
would see, and it’s out of my book ye have
gotten a’ ye ken. What does the man
mean shaking hands wi’ Sandy Muir?”</p>

<p>“It’s no for me—it’s for the bairns—it’s
for Harry,” said Alexander.</p>

<p>“Hairy! and what has Hairy to do
wi’t, I would like to ken? He’s but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
far-away friend; forbye being a prodigal,
that it wad be a shame to trust guid siller
wi’—Hairy!—the man’s daft! what has
he to do with John Allenders?”</p>

<p>“A little,” said Cuthbert, smiling.
“He is the <i>heir</i> of John Allenders, Miss
Calder.”</p>

<p>“The heir!” the old woman’s face grew
red with anger. “I tell ye he had nae
lawful heir, if it binna the ane surviving
that did him kindness. It’s you that
disna ken. Hairy Muir is but niece’s son
to me.”</p>

<p>“But he is grandson to Rose Allenders,”
said Cuthbert, “and the heir of her
father.”</p>

<p>Miss Jean stood still for a moment,
digesting the strange purport of those
words; at last she stretched forward her
hand to clutch the Bible. “The book’s
mine—ye ken nocht but what ye have
gotten out of my book—gie it back to me,
ye deceivers. Am I gaun to gie my goods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
think ye, to better Hairy Muir? Na, na,—ye
have come to the wrang hand; give
me back my book.”</p>

<p>“There is some property in the case,”
said Cuthbert, keeping his hand upon the
Bible: “It cannot come to you, Miss Jean;
for, though I believe you were very kind
to them, you are not related to John
Allenders; but Harry Muir is. Now,
whether would it be better that this property
should go to a stranger, or to your
nephew who is in your debt?”</p>

<p>Miss Jean had been eager to interrupt
him, but his last words were a weighty
utterance. She paused to consider. “Ye’re
a clever chield,” she said at last, with a
harsh laugh. “I wadna say but ye could
put a case gey weel. My nephew that’s
in my debt—and so he is, that’s true—what
kind o’ property is’t? ye’ll be a
writer, I reckon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cuthbert, with a smile, “I
am a writer. It is some land—a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
estate, Miss Jean; but only one who is a
descendant of John Allenders, can be the
heir, and that is Harry Muir.”</p>

<p>“Weel, I take ye to witness that what
ye have said is true,” said the old woman
eagerly; “that this lad is in my debt;
and payment I’ll hae afore he bruiks the
possession a week. Wasna it out of my
book ye got a’ ye ken? and wha has sae
muckle claim to consideration as me? I
take ye to witness; and you, ye auld sneck-drawer—it
was this ye was thinking about
a’ the time?—Oh Sandy Muir! me, in my
innocence, thinking ye were taking this
pains to do me a guid turn: as ye’re
awn me a day in harst, a’body kens; and
you thinking o’ yoursel a’ the time. I
wonder ye can have the face to look at
me!”</p>

<p>“I am seeking nothing for mysel, Miss
Jean,” said Alexander, with a little pride,
“the little I have will soon go to the
bairns, as this will do. And I am thankful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
to say I owe ye nothing, if it be not
in the way of good will.”</p>

<p>“Guid will, said he! bonnie guid will
to take a braw inheritance out frae under
my very een,” said the old woman, bitterly.
“I hand ye bound for the value of
that book, Sandy Muir, mind. I’ll haud
ye bound, and you too, my braw lad;
sae if ye tak it away the noo ye sall bring
it back again, or it will be a’ the waur for
yoursels. Mind what I say; I’ll hae my
goods spoiled and my gear lifted for nae
man in this world.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert promised, with all reverence, to
restore the Bible, which he had considerable
fears he would not be permitted to
take away; and after they had soothed,
so far as was possible, her bitter humour,
Miss Jean, with as much courtesy as she
was capable of, suffered them, rich in these
precious documents, to depart.</p>

<p>“I’ll no can speak to Miss Jean to day,
Katie,” whispered uncle Sandy, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
little girl stole after them down stairs;
“but keep you a good heart, my bonnie
woman, there’s blythe days coming—and
may be I’ll take ye to see your mother
myself.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure this will do, Mr. Charteris?”
continued the old man, when they
were again on their way to the town.</p>

<p>Cuthbert was in great spirits. “I will
astonish Davie Lindsay,” he said, smiling.
“Oh yes, it will do, it was just the thing
I wanted. Now we must have the register
of the different marriages and births;
that part of it will be easily managed, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“My brother James’s Family Bible is
in my house,” said uncle Sandy, “and he
was married by Mr. Clunie, of the Old
Kirk. I will go to the session clerk to-night,
if you like, or it will be time
enough the morn. He is never far out of
the way, being an old man like myself,
half idle, half independent. And, speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
of that, ye must see my garden, Mr.
Charteris, though this is hardly the best
time.”</p>

<p>“You seem to keep it in excellent order,”
said Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“It’s no bad; you see, Mr. Charteris,
the house is my own, and so is it,” said
the old man, with a little natural pride,
desiring to intimate that the substance
was not altogether on the Calder side of
Harry’s ancestry; “and it is just a pleasure
to me to dibble at it in my own way. Indeed
I think sometimes that it’s this work
of mine, and the pleasure of seeing the
new life aye coming up through the soil,
that makes me like the bairns so well.”</p>

<p>“It has not always so pleasant a result,”
said Charteris.</p>

<p>“Mostly, I think, mostly,” said Alexander.
“For example, now, how could ye
think a man that had such thoughts in his
heart to a mouse or a gowan, as Burns had,
could harm or be unkindly to the bits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
buds of his own race; though to be sure
I am not minding what a strong part evil
had in that grand earthen vessel. Woes
me! that what might have been a great
light in the land should be but a beacon
on the black rocks; but I never mind that
when I read the Cottar.”</p>

<p>“The Cottar is your favourite, I think,”
said Charteris.</p>

<p>“Aye—I confess I like them all, ill as
some of them are,” said the poet’s countryman;
“but the Cottar is near perfect to
my vision—all but one place, where he puts
in an apostrophe that breaks the story—that
about ‘Sweet Jenny’s unsuspecting
youth’—you mind? I aye skip that. He
kent ill ower weel, poor man.”</p>

<span class="allsmcap">CARLYLE.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning, Cuthbert busied
himself in obtaining extracts from registers.
The proof he procured was very full
and clear, establishing the legal as well as
the moral certainty.</p>

<p>That day the family at Port Dundas
were pursuing their ordinary employments
with a greater hush and stillness about
them than usual. Martha and Rose sat
together, sewing in the parlour. They
were both very silent—in the exhaustion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
of hopelessness, afraid to speak to each
other of the one great subject which absorbed
their thoughts. Agnes had gone
with her baby in her arms to the kitchen
to speak to Mrs. Rodger, and was lingering
there a little, willing to be delivered from
herself; while Violet had carried out a
little wondering pre-occupied heart into
the midst of a juvenile assembly in front
of the house, and was gradually awaking
out of abstraction into vigorous play.</p>

<p>The prospect was very cheerful from the
window. Yonder little Maggie McGillivray,
with unfailing industry, clipped and
sang at her mother’s door under the full
sunshine of noon; and here, upon the
pavement, the little form of Violet, poised
on one foot, pursued the marble “pitcher”
through the chalked “beds” necessary for
the game, while her playmates stood round
watching lest she should infringe its rules,
and Mrs. McGarvie’s tawny truculent Tiger
winked in the sunshine as he sat complacently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
looking on. The very din of traffic
in the busy street was cheering and life-like;
but the two sisters, sat with their
little muslin curtain drawn, sick at heart.</p>

<p>At the window in the kitchen Miss
Aggie Rodger stretched her considerable
length upon the deal table, while the hapless
idle Johnnie occupied his usual chair
by the fireside, and Miss Jeanie in a dress
a little, and only a little, better arranged
than her sister, sat on the wooden stool
near her, very prim and very busy. Miss
Aggie had laid down her work, and from
the table was making desperate lunges at
the crowing baby.</p>

<p>In a dingy printed gown, girded round
her waist by an apron professedly white,
but as dingy as the print, and with a broad
black ribbon tyeing down her widow’s
cap, Mrs. Rodger stood conversing with
the lodger. “This is Thursday,” said
Agnes, “by the end of next week, Mrs.
Rodger, I shall be ready with the rent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>

<p>“Very weel, Mrs. Muir,” responded the
widow, “what suits you will suit me. It’s
a new thing to me, I assure you, to be needing
to seek siller. When Archie was to the
fore—and a guid man he was to me, and a
guid father to the weans—I never ance
thought of such a needcessity as this; but
are maun submit to what’s imposed; and
then there’s thae wearifu’ taxes, and gas,
and water. I declare it’s enough to pit
folk daft—nae suner ae body’s turned frae
the door than anither chaps—it’s just an
even down imposition.”</p>

<p>“Look at the pet—Luick, see! eh!
ye wee rogue, will ye break my side
comb,” cried Miss Aggie, shaking the baby
with furious affection, from which the
young mother shrunk a little.</p>

<p>“Dinna be sae wild, Aggie,” said her
prim sister. “Ye’ll frighten the wean.”</p>

<p>“Never you fash your head, Jean. Are
ye there, ye wee pet? Eh, if he hasna
pitten his finger through yin o’ the holes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span></p>

<p>Miss Aggie hurriedly snatched up her
work, and the little wife drew away the
baby in alarm. “Has he done much
harm,” asked Agnes, “give it me, and I
will put it in again.”</p>

<p>“It’s nane the waur,” said the good-humoured
hoyden, cutting out the injured
“hole” with her scissors. “I’ll put it in
with a stitch of point—it’s nae size. Jean’s
at a new stitch, Mrs. Muir—did ye ever
see it?”</p>

<p>“It’s rather a pretty thing,” said Miss
Jeanie, exhibiting it with prim complacence.
“I learned it from Beenie Ure, at
the warehouse, and it’s no ill to do. I was
thinking of coming ben, to show Miss
Rose; but it’s no every body that Beenie
would have learned it to.”</p>

<p>“Wha’s that at the outer door?” asked
the idle brother, whose listless unoccupied
life had made him quick to note all passing
sounds.</p>

<p>“Losh me!” said Miss Aggie, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
up, “its Mr. Muir, and he’s in an awfu’
hurry.”</p>

<p>Agnes ran to open the door. It was
indeed Harry, and the face of pale excitement
which he turned upon her, struck
the poor wife to the heart. Little Violet
ran up the stair after him, with eager
curiosity. There was a sullenness, quite
unusual to it, on the colourless face of poor
Harry. He passed his wife without saying
a word.</p>

<p>“Are you ill? what brings you home
at this time? what is the matter, Harry?”
cried the terrified Agnes.</p>

<p>He only pressed before her into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>As Harry entered, with Agnes and little
Violet close behind him, the two melancholy
workers in the parlour, started in
painful surprise. “Harry is ill!” exclaimed
Rose, with the constant instinct of apology,
as she threw down her work on the table.</p>

<p>“What now, Harry? what new misfortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
has come upon us now?” asked the
sterner voice of Martha.</p>

<p>“Harry, what is it? what ails you?”
said poor Agnes, clinging to his arm.</p>

<p>He took off his hat, and began to press
it between his hands. “Agnes, Martha,”
said the young man with a husky dry
voice, “it’s not my fault—not this time—I’ve
lost my situation.”</p>

<p>The little wife uttered a low cry, and
looked at him and the baby. Lost his
situation! the sole means of getting them
bread.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Harry?” asked
Martha.</p>

<p>The young man’s sullen, despairing eye
glanced round them all. Then he flung
his hat on the table, and threw himself into
the arm-chair. “I mean that, that’s all.
I’ve lost my situation.”</p>

<p>For a moment they stood still, looking
in each other’s blank faces, as people do at
the first stroke of a calamity; then Agnes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
put the baby into the arms of Rose, and
herself glided round to the back of her
husband’s chair. She could not bear to
see him cast himself down so, and hide his
face in his hands. Her own eyes were
half blinded with tears, and her gentle
heart failing; but however she might
suffer herself, she could not see Harry so
utterly cast down.</p>

<p>Violet stole again to the stool at his
feet, and sat looking up in his face with
the breathless interest of her years. Poor
Agnes tried to draw away the hands from
his face. He resisted her fretfully. Rose
went softly about the room with the child,
hushing its baby glee, and turning tearful
eyes on Harry; but Martha stood, fixed
as she had risen on his entrance, her hands
firmly grasping the back of her chair, and
her head bowed down.</p>

<p>The tears of poor Agnes were falling
upon his clasped fingers. Hastily the unfortunate
young man uncovered his face.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
“I suppose I shall have to sit by the fire
like John Rodger, and let you be a slave
for me,” he exclaimed bitterly, clasping
his wife’s hands. Agnes could do nothing
but weep and murmur “Harry! Harry!”</p>

<p>“I will work on the streets first—I will
do anything,” said Harry, in hysteric excitement.
“I am not broken down yet,
Agnes, for all they say. I can work for
you yet. I will <i>be</i> anything, I will <i>do</i>
anything, rather than let want come to
<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>And the little wife wept over the hands
that convulsively clasped her own, and
could only sob again, “Oh, Harry, Harry!”</p>

<p>“Harry,” said Martha, “what have you
done? Let us understand it clearly. Answer
first one thing. Lift up your head,
and answer me, Harry. Is the fault
yours? Is it a misfortune or a sin?”</p>

<p>He did not meet her earnest, anxious eye;
but he answered slowly, “The fault is not
mine, Martha. I was, indeed, exasperated;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
but it was not me. I am free of this,
Martha; it was no blame of mine.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with jealous scrutiny;
she fancied there was a faltering in his
voice, and that he dared not lift his eyes
to meet her own, and the misery of doubt
convulsed Martha’s heart. Could she believe
him?</p>

<p>“If it is so,” she said, with a calmness
which seemed hard and cold to Rose, “I
see no reason you have to be so much cast
down. Agnes, do not cry. This working
on the street is quite an unnecessary
addition to the shock Harry has given
us.”</p>

<p>“<i>If</i> it is so!” cried Harry, with quick
anger. “Martha, do you not believe me?
will you not trust my word?”</p>

<p>“Be composed,” said Martha, herself
sitting down with a hopeless composure
quite unusual to her; “tell us what the
cause is calmly, Harry. It is a great misfortune;
but every misfortune is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
borne. Let us look at it without exaggeration;
tell me the cause.”</p>

<p>He had worn her patience out, and the
aspect her exhaustion took was that of extreme
patience. It surprised and hushed
them all. Rose laid the baby in his cradle,
and stealthily took up her work. Agnes
withdrew her hand from Harry’s grasp;
even he himself wiped his damp brow, and
sat erect in his chair.</p>

<p>“I went to-day to the Bank to get a
cheque cashed,” he said, in his usual manner;
“it was a small cheque, only fifty pounds,
and I put the notes in my coat pocket.
Everybody does it. I did in that respect
just as I have always done; but I was
robbed to-day—robbed of the whole sum.”</p>

<p>“What then?” said Martha, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Of course I went at once and told
Dick Buchanan. His father is not at
home, and Dick took it upon him to reprove
me for carelessness, and—various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
other things,” said Harry, with assumed
bravado. “So we got to high words—I
confess it, Martha. I was not inclined to
submit to that from him, which I could
scarcely bear from you. And the result
was what I have told you—I gave up my
situation, or rather he dismissed me.”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, for Martha’s
composure hushed the condolences which
otherwise would have comforted poor
Harry, and made him feel himself a martyr
after all.</p>

<p>“What did young Buchanan blame you
for?—not,” said Martha, a rapid flush
covering her face as she looked at her brother,
“not with any suspicion—not for
<i>this</i>.”</p>

<p>He returned her look with one of honest
and unfeigned indignation. “Martha!”</p>

<p>“I did not know,” said Martha hurriedly.
“The lad is a coarse lad. I did
not know what you meant. What did he
blame you for, Harry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span></p>

<p>A guilty flush stole over Harry’s face.
He sighed deeply. “For many things,
Martha,” he said with simplicity, “for
which you have blamed me often.”</p>

<p>The stern questioner was melted. It
was some time before she could resume her
inquiries. “And how did it happen?
How did you lose the money, Harry?”
said Rose.</p>

<p>“It was no such wonder,” answered
Harry with a little impatience. “It is a
thing that happens every day—at least
many men have been robbed before me.
They lie in wait about the banks, these
fellows.”</p>

<p>“And what way did you put it into
your pocket, Harry?” said Violet. “I
would have held it in my hand.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Violet; what do you know
about it?” exclaimed Harry angrily.</p>

<p>“And was it near the Bank you were
robbed?” inquired Agnes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span></p>

<p>Harry faltered a little. “Not very far
from it.”</p>

<p>“And did nobody see the thief? Surely
if it was done in the open street, somebody
must have seen who did it,” said Rose.</p>

<p>Harry’s eyes were cast down. “No,”
he muttered in a very low tone, “they
know their business too well to let anybody
see them.”</p>

<p>“Was it done in the street?” asked
Martha quickly.</p>

<p>He faltered still more. “I don’t know—not
exactly in the street, I think. I
met the captain of one of our—of one of
Buchanan’s ships; and I—I went with
him to a place he was going to call at. I
suppose it might be done about there.”</p>

<p>Poor Harry! his head was bowed down—his
fingers were fumbling with the table-cover.
He could not meet the eyes which
were fixed so anxiously upon him.</p>

<p>A low groan came from Martha’s lips—it
was hard to relinquish the comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
of believing that his besetting sin had no
share in this misfortune—hard to have
the courage quenched out of a heart, which
could be buoyant, joyous, in the face of
trials and dangers appointed by heaven, to
be suffered and overcome—but who could
do nothing against a weakness so inveterate
and strong as this.</p>

<p>There was nothing more said for a time—they
all felt this add a pang to their
misfortune; but while Martha’s eyes
were still fixed on the ground, and Rose
and Agnes forbore to look at him, in
delicate care for his humiliation, Harry
had already lifted his head, and growing
familiar with his position, forgot that there
was in it any humiliation at all.</p>

<p>“I forgot to tell you,” he said, “what
will be very hard upon us—very hard
indeed—these monied men have hearts
like the nether millstone. Agnes, I don’t
know what you will do with your accounts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
I have lost my quarter’s salary as well as
my situation.”</p>

<p>The poor little wife looked at him
aghast. She had been scheming already
how she could get these accounts paid,
and begin to “the opening” herself, to
keep them afloat until Harry should hear
of some other situation;—but this crowning
calamity struck her dumb.</p>

<p>“They will hold me responsible for the
whole fifty pounds,” said Harry, in a low
voice. “I don’t think Mr. Buchanan
himself would have kept back this that
is owing me—this that I have worked
for. I should not care so much for the
whole debt,” said poor Harry with glistening
eyes, “because it would be a spur to me
to labour more strenuously, and I don’t
doubt we might pay it off in a year or
two—but to throw me on the world, and
keep back this poor fifteen pounds—it is
very cruel—to leave us without anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
to depend on, until I can get another
situation—it is very hard—but they do
not know what it is to want five pounds,
those prosperous men. Mr. Buchanan
himself would never have done it—and to
think that Dick should turn upon me!”</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Martha harshly, “I
am pleased that he has kept this money—how
we are to do I cannot tell—but I
would not have had you take it, Harry.
What you have lost was theirs, and we
must make it up. Some way or other
we will struggle through, and it is far
better that you did not become further
indebted to them by receiving this.”</p>

<p>Harsh as her tone was, it was not
blame—poor Harry’s sanguine spirit rose.
He could take some comfort from the
bitter pride that would rather descend to
the very depths of poverty than have
such a debt as this. The galling burden
seemed for the moment to withdraw
Martha’s thoughts from the more-enduring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
misery, the weakness that plunged
him into so many misfortunes.</p>

<p>But Agnes, sadly considering how to
satisfy the poor widow, Mrs. Rodger, who
could not do without her money, and how
to apologise to butcher, baker, and grocer,—could
take no comfort;—darkly the
cloud of grave care settled down upon
the soft young features. “But what
will I do with Mrs. Rodger,” said Agnes,
“and Waters, and Mr. Fleming—oh
Martha!”</p>

<p>“I will speak to them myself,” said
Martha, compressing her lips painfully.
“You shall not be subjected to this,
Agnes—I will speak to them myself.”</p>

<p>“And Mrs. McGarvie,” said Agnes, “I
might have done the things myself if I
had only known—and Mrs. Rodger.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Rodger must be paid,” said
Martha. “I am going to the warehouse
to-day—we must see—we must think
about it all, Agnes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>

<p>But they made no reference to Harry.
Rose, who had said nothing all this time,
was already working very rapidly, pausing
for an instant sometimes to look round
upon them with affectionate wistfulness,
but scarcely slackening the speed of her
needle even then; there was such occasion
for labour now, as there had never
been before.</p>

<p>Poor Harry! He sat in silence, and
heard them discuss those sad economics—he
saw that they made no reference to
him; and the bitterness of having lost
the confidence of those whose strong and
deep affection could not be doubted, even
by the most morbid pride, smote him to
the heart. A momentary perception of
his position disclosed itself to Harry, and
with the instant spring of his elastic
temperament, he felt that to perceive was
to correct, and that the power lay with
himself to recover all that he had lost.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
With a sudden start he turned to his wife
and his sister.</p>

<p>“Agnes!—Martha!—why do you look
so miserable? I will get another situation.
We may be better yet than we
ever were before.”</p>

<p>“And so we may,” said Martha, pressing
her hand to her forehead, “and so we
may—we will always hope and look for
the best.”</p>

<p>Her voice sounded like a knell. Agnes,
who was not quick to discover shades of
implied meaning, brightened at the words—but
Rose, who deprecated and softened
in other cases, could oppose nothing to
this. It made herself sick and hopeless—for
worse than all impatience or harshness
was this conscious yielding to fruitless
and false hope, as one yields to a fretful
child.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been Martha’s custom at all times
to take upon herself the disagreeable things
of their daily life. A turbulent stormy
spirit, it was impossible to form any
apprehension of her character without
taking into account the harsh and strong
pride which had come undiminished
through all her trials;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p class="noin">the slights and trifling disrespects which
are only felt by the refined poor—all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
these petty indignities were bitter to
Martha, yet she had a certain satisfaction
in compelling herself to endure them. To
stand among the indiscriminate host who
maintained themselves as she did; to
submit her work to the inspection of
some small official; to listen patiently
to comments upon it, made for the sake of
preserving a needful importance and superiority;
these and many a trifling insult
more were very hard to bear—but there
was a bitter pleasure in bowing to them,
a stormy joy in the conscious force with
which she subdued her own rebellious nature,
and put her foot upon its neck. It
was conquering her pride, she thought,
and she conquered it proudly, using its
own might to vanquish itself.</p>

<p>But though Martha could bear needful
humiliations herself, this pride of hers,
which enabled her to bear them, built a
mighty wall round her children. She
could not bear humiliation to brother or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
sister; they were hers—heart of her heart,
crown of her honour—and with the constant
watchfulness of jealous love she
guarded them from derogation. With
courage unfailing she could bear what was
needful to be borne if it might be in her
own person, but if it fell on them, the
blow struck to her heart.</p>

<p>And so she passed through crowds of
prosperous people, who never bestowed a
second look upon her—a woman growing
old, with grey streaks in her hair, and
harsh lines in her face—a <i>poor</i> woman,
distressed and full of care—what was there
to look at? But if some magic had
changed the bodily form, which was a veil
to her, into the person of some noble
despot king, foiled and despairing, there
was enough to rivet the eyes of a world.</p>

<p>She was carrying back a fortnight’s
laborious work—and filling up all the interstices
of the greater misery, which did not
change, were a hundred shifting plans of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
how to distribute this pittance. A strange
chaos was in Martha’s mind as she went
through those crowded streets. Broken
prayers, so often repeated that they came
vacantly into her mind often, and often
fell upon her like strong inspirations,
forcing her almost to cry aloud in an
agony of entreaty, mingled with those
painful calculations of the petty sum she
was about to receive, which hovered like
so many irritating insects over the dull
and heavy pain in her heart. The cloud
would not disperse; the weight would not
lighten from her. Harry, at home, had
smiles of new confidence on his face
already, and had talked Agnes and Rose
into hope; but the days of hope were past
for Martha. She desired to submit; she
longed to bend her neck meekly under the
yoke, and acquiesce in what God sent;
but the struggle was hard, and it seemed
to herself that she could have submitted
easily to any affliction but this—this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
the intolerable pain—and this was her
fate.</p>

<p>The warehouse was in the Candleriggs,
and a spruce clerk received the work from
her, and paid her the joint wages of Rose
and herself for the fortnight’s labour. It
was thirty shillings—a very little sum,
though they thought it good. On rare
occasions the weekly produce of their
united toil was as much as a pound, but
this was a more usual amount.</p>

<p>Filling her little basket with the renewed
and increased supply of work given
at her request, Martha turned to one of
the dim streets of counting-houses which
surround the Exchange. In the same line
of buildings the Buchanans had their
office, but Martha was not going there.
She ascended another dusty stair at some
little distance, and entering a smaller office,
asked for Mr. Sommerville.</p>

<p>Mr. Sommerville was a ruddy comfortable
man, in an easy chair; once a poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Ayrshire lad, now, totally forgetful of that
time, a cautious, shrewd, wealthy merchant,
richer than many of the splendid
commercial magnates who lightened the
dim sky around him. But some claim of
distant kindred or ancient acquaintance
connected him with the family of the
Muirs; though his look of doubt as Martha
entered, and his laconic greeting,
“Oh, Miss Muir,” when he recognised
her, showed that this claim was of the
slenderest kind.</p>

<p>“I have come to speak to you about
my brother,” said Martha, standing before
him with a flush upon her face; “I mean
I have taken the liberty, Mr. Sommerville—for
Harry has lost his situation.”</p>

<p>“What! the place I got for him in
Buchanan’s?” exclaimed the merchant.
“What has he done that for? some misconduct
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No misconduct,” said Martha, with
sudden courage; “nor have you the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
slightest ground for supposing so. Harry
had money stolen from him on his way
between the bank and the office—a thing
which no one could foresee, and which has
happened to many a wiser man. This is
the cause; but this is not misconduct.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sommerville waved his hand impatiently.
“Yes, yes, I understand; I see.
Money stolen from him: <i>I</i> never had
money stolen from me. But I never will
recommend a man again; they invariably
turn out ill. How much was it?”</p>

<p>“Fifty pounds.” said Martha, “for all
of which he is responsible, and, if he were
but in another situation, which we would
not fail to pay.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, that’s all very well,” said the
merchant, “but how is he to get the other
situation? There must have been great
carelessness, you know, or they never
would have dismissed him. I heard he
was wild; young Buchanan told me he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
was wild—but I did not expect it was to
end so soon.”</p>

<p>“And neither it shall,” said Martha,
controlling, with absolute physical pain,
the fierce hot anger of her mother-like
love. “Mr. Buchanan has already taken
from Harry a proportion of this sum. I
pledge myself that the rest shall be
paid.”</p>

<p>“You!” He looked at her. Certainly,
her name would not have been of the
smallest importance at a bill; but glimmerings
of truth higher than bills, or
money values, will flash sometimes even
on stolid men. For a moment his eyes
rested strangely upon her; and then he
turned away his head, and said, “Humph!”
in a kind of confidential under tone. The
good man rubbed his bushy hair in perplexity.
He did not know what to make
of this.</p>

<p>“But unless Harry has employment we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
can do nothing,” said Martha, “all that is
in our power, without him, must be the
mere necessities of living. You have
helped us before, Mr. Sommerville.”</p>

<p>“If that was to be a reason for exerting
myself again, in every case of distress that
comes to me,” said the merchant with
complacency, “I can tell you, I might
give up all other business at once; but
recommending a man who turns out ill is
a very unpleasant thing to creditable
people. There is Buchanan now—of course
he took my word for your brother—and I
assure you I felt it quite a personal reflection
when his son told me that Muir was
wild.”</p>

<p>“And his son dared!” exclaimed Martha,
with uncontrollable indignation, “and this
youth who does evil of voluntary intent
and purpose is believed when he slanders
Harry! Harry, whom this very lad—that
he should have power, vulgar and coarse
as he is, with a brother of mine!—has betrayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and beguiled into temptation. But
I do wrong to speak of this. The present
matter is no fault of Harry’s, yet
it is the sole reason why he loses his
situation; and I see no ground here for
any one saying that my brother has disgraced
them.”</p>

<p>Strong emotion is always powerful. It
might be that Mr. Sommerville had no
objection to hear Richard Buchanan condemned.
It might be that Martha’s fierce
defence awoke some latent generosity in
the mind she addressed. However that
might be, the merchant did not resent her
outburst, but answered it indistinctly in a
low voice, and ended with something about
“partiality,” and “quite natural.”</p>

<p>“I am not partial,” said Martha hastily.
“No one has ever seen, no one can ever
see, Harry’s faults as I do. I am not indifferent
enough to pass over any one
defect he has; but Harry is young. He
has reached the time when men are but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
experimenting in independent life. Why
should he lose his good name for a common
misfortune like this?”</p>

<p>“You should have stayed in Ayr,” said
Mr. Sommerville, with a little weariness.
“<i>I</i> don’t want to injure his good name!
I have no object in hurting your brother;
indeed, for the sake of the old town, and
some other things, I would help him to a
situation if I could. I’ll just speak to my
cash-keeper. He knows about vacant places
better than I do.”</p>

<p>And partly to get rid of a visitor whose
unusual earnestness embarrassed him;
partly out of a sudden apprehension that
he might possibly be called upon by and
by for pecuniary help, if no situation could
be got for Harry, Mr. Sommerville left
his easy chair, and had a consultation in
the outer office with his confidential clerk.
Very weary and faint, Martha remained
standing in the private room. Many a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
time in her own heart, with the bitterness
of disappointed hope and wounded love,
she had condemned Harry; but with the
fierceness of a lion-mother, her heart sprang
up to defend him when another voice pronounced
his sentence. She could not bear
the slightest touch of censure—instinctively
she dared and defied whosoever should accuse
him—and no one had liberty to blame
Harry except the solitary voice which came
to her in the night watches wrung out of
her own heart.</p>

<p>In a short time Mr. Sommerville returned.</p>

<p>“I hear of one place, Miss Muir,” said
the merchant; “but there is security
needed, and that might be a drawback—seventy
pounds a-year—a good salary, but
then they want security for five hundred
pounds. If you could manage that, the
place is a very good one—Rowan and
Thomson—and it is a traveller they want—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
so much confinement as in an office;
it might suit your brother very well, if it
were not for the security.”</p>

<p>“It would not do,” said Martha, quickly.
“Harry cannot be a traveller—it would
kill him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sommerville elevated his eyebrows.
“Cannot be a traveller! Upon my word,
Miss Muir, to say that you came asking
my help, you are very fastidious. I
fancied your brother would be glad of any
situation.”</p>

<p>“Not this—only not this,” said Martha,
in haste, as if she almost feared to listen
to the proposal, “Harry is not strong. I
thank you, Mr. Sommerville, I thank you;
but it would kill him.”</p>

<p>“Then, I know of nothing else,” said
the merchant, coldly resuming his seat.
“If I hear of anything, I will let you
know.”</p>

<p>Cold words of course, often said, never
remembered. Martha turned away down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the dusty stair, blaming herself for thus
wasting the time in which she might have
been working; but she could work—could
give daily bread to the little household
still—and that was the greatest comfort of
her life.</p>

<p>Far different from the mill-girls and
engineers of Port Dundas was the passing
population in these dusty streets. Elderly
merchantmen, with ease and competence
in every fold of their spotless broadcloth—young
ones exuberant and unclouded,
casting off the yoke of business as lightly,
out of the office, as they bore it sensibly
within, met Martha at every step. Here
come some, fresh from the Exchange. You
can see they are discussing speculations,
calculating elaborate chances, perhaps “in
the way of business,” hazarding a princely
fortune, which may be doubled or dissolved
before another year. And a group of
young men meet them, louder and more
demonstrative, circling round one who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
clearly the object of interest to all. Why?—he
is going out to India to-morrow to
make his fortune—and save that it gives
him a little importance, and makes him
the lion of the day, envied by all his
compeers, this youth, who is flushed just
now with a little excitement, in reality
feels no more about his Indian voyage,
than if it were but a summer expedition
to the Gairloch, or Roseneath Bay; and
is much more comfortably assured of
making his fortune, than he would be of
bringing home a creditable amount of
trout, if the event of to-morrow was a
day’s fishing, instead of the beginning of
an eventful life. Of the youths round
him, one will be the representative partner
of his “house” in far America before the
year is out; another will feed wool in the
bush; another learn to adorn his active
northern life, with oriental pomps and
luxuries by the blue waves of the Bosphorus.
And among them all there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
certain fresh confident unconscious life,
which, so far as it goes, carries you with
it in sympathy. It is not refined, it is
not profound, it has little elevation and
little depth; but withal it has such a
fresh breeze about it, such a continual
unceasing motion, such an undoubting
confidence in its own success, that this
simplicity of worldliness moves you as if
it were something nobler. Not true
enough, nor great enough to call the
solemn “God speed” out of your heart;
yet you cannot choose, but wish the young
adventurers well.</p>

<p>And there are clerks more hurried;
young men with quick business-step and
eye, whose sons shall be merchants’ sons,
as carelessly prosperous as are the young
masters in the office now; but some who
will live and die poor clerks, yet who will
have their share of enjoyed life as well,
and end their days as pleasantly, pass and
repass among the crowd. Some, too, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
will sink and fall, who will break hearts,
and give fair hopes the death-blow. So
much young life—so many souls, each to
make its own existence for itself, and not
another. There come solemn thoughts
into the mind which looks on such a
scene.</p>

<p>And Martha, half abstracted, looked on
it, comparing them with Harry. But
there was none like Harry—not one; the
heart that clasped its arms about him in
his misfortune—the dry eye which watched
the night long with schemes for his prosperity—could
see none worthy to be placed
beside him. Poor Harry! his sister could
not see these others, for his continual
shadow resting on her heart.</p>

<p>When Martha had nearly reached the
Exchange, she heard some one calling after
her. It was John Buchanan; he came up
out of breath.</p>

<p>“Will you tell Harry that I think he
should come down and see my father, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Muir?” gasped John. “I’ve been chasing
you for ten minutes—you walk so fast.
My father’s come home, and he’s shut up
with Dick. I don’t think he’s pleased.
If Harry would come down to-morrow, it
might be all right again.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Seventy</span> pounds a-year,” repeated
Harry Muir, as his sisters and his wife sat
round him, all of them now busy with the
“opening,” while Violet kept the baby;
“and my uncle might be security, say for
three hundred pounds. It’s a mere matter
of form, you know. Perhaps they would
take him for three hundred instead of five;
and Rowan and Thomson is a very good
house. I think I might go down to-morrow
and inquire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span></p>

<p>“It would not do—you must not think
of it,” said Martha quickly.</p>

<p>“Why must I not think of it? I don’t
believe John Buchanan is right, Martha,
about his father quarrelling with Dick for
sending me away. And, besides, how could
I return there, where they all know I was
dismissed—<i>dismissed</i>, Martha; besides
Dick’s own abuse. I could not do it. I
would rather do anything than go back;—and
seventy pounds a-year!”</p>

<p>“Harry, let us rather labour for you
night and day.”</p>

<p>His face grew red and angry. “Why,
Martha? I am not a child surely that I
cannot be trusted. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Martha bitterly, “you are
not a child; you are a full-grown man,
with all the endowments a man needs to
do something in the world. You can constrain
the will of these poor girls, who
think of you every hour they live; and
you can assert your independence, and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
proud, and refuse to bear the reproof you
have justly earned. God forgive me if I
am too hard; but you wear me out, Harry.
When I say you must not seek for a fatal
occupation like this, have I not cause?
Do I need to descend to particulars?
Would you have me enter into detail?”</p>

<p>“Martha! Martha!” The trembling
hand of Rose was on her arm, anxiously
restraining her; and Agnes looked up
into the sullen cloud on Harry’s face,
whispering, “Do not be angry; she does
not mean it, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Is it because I am in your power that
you taunt me, Martha?” he said, fiercely.</p>

<p>Martha compressed her lips till they
grew white; she did not answer. After
the first outburst, not even the cruel injustice
of this received a reply. She had
herself to subdue before she could again
approach him.</p>

<p>And the two peacemakers, hovering between
them, endeavoured, with anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
pains, to heal the breach again. The
young wife whispered deprecatory words
in Harry’s ear, while she laid her hand on
Martha: but pitiful looks were all the
artillery of Rose; they softened both the
belligerents.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what happens to us out
of the house, Martha,” said Rose at last;
“but surely we may be at peace within.
There are not so many of us in the world;
we should be always friends.”</p>

<p>And Martha’s anger was shortlived.
“I spoke rashly,” she said, with strange
humility; “let us say no more of this
now.”</p>

<p>And there was little more said that
night.</p>

<p>But Harry would not go to the office
again to see Mr. Buchanan; and, poor as
they were, none of them desired to subject
him to this humiliation. So he went out
instead the next morning to make bootless
<span class ="err" title="original: nquiries">inquiries</span> and write bootless letters—exertions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
in which there was no hope and
little spirit; went out gloomily, and in
gloom returned, seeking comfort which
they had not to bestow.</p>

<p>But while poor Harry was idle perforce,
a spasmodic industry had fallen upon the
rest. They scarcely paused to take the
simple meals of necessary life; and the
pleasant hour of family talk at tea was
abridged to-night to ten minutes, sadly
grudged by the eager labourers, on whose
toil alone depended now the maintenance
of the family. Little Violet stood by the
table with a clean towel in her hand, preparing,
with some importance, to wash the
cups and saucers when they had finished.
But Harry lingered over the table, leaning
his head on his hand, and trifling with
something which lay by him. Violet,
in housewifely impatience, moved about
among the cups, and rung them against
each other to rouse his attention, and let
him see he retarded her; but Harry’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
mind was too much occupied to notice
that.</p>

<p>“Harry,” cried Agnes, rather tremulously
from the inner room, “I see Mr.
Gilchrist on the road. He is coming here.
What can it be?”</p>

<p>Harry started and put away his cup.
They all became anxious and nervous;
and Agnes hastily drew her seat close to
the door of the room, that she might hear
what the visitor said, though her baby,
half dressed, lay on her knee, very sleepy
and impatient, and she could not make
her appearance till she had laid him in his
little crib for the night.</p>

<p>Thus announced, Mr. Gilchrist entered
the room. He was a massy large man,
with grizzled hair, which had been reddish
in his younger days, and kindly grey eyes
gleaming out from under shaggy eyebrows.
His linen was spotless; but his dress,
though quite appropriate and respectable,
was not very trim; little layers of snuff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
encumbered the folds of his black waistcoat;
and from a steel chain of many complicated
links, attached to the large round
silver watch in his fob, hung two massy
gold seals, one of them engraven with an
emphatic “J. G.” of his own, the other
an inheritance from his father. There
was no mistaking the character and standing
of this good and honourable man; his
father before him had been head clerk in
an extensive mercantile house in Glasgow;
his sons after him might be that, or
greater than that. With his two hundred
pounds a-year, he was bringing up such a
family as should hereafter do honour and
service to their country and community;
and for himself, no better citizen did his
endeavour for the prosperity of the town,
or prayed with a warmer heart, “Let
Glasgow flourish.”</p>

<p>“Harry, my man,” said Mr. Gilchrist, as
he held Harry’s hand in his own, and shook
it slowly, “I am very sorry about this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it cannot be helped,” said
Harry with a little assumed carelessness,
“we must make the best we can of it
now.”</p>

<p>“Ay, no doubt,” said the Cashier, as
he turned to shake hands with Rose and
Martha, “to sit down and brood over a
misfortune, is not the way to mend it;
but it may not be so bad as you think.
Angry folk will cool down, Harry, if ye
leave them to themselves a little.”</p>

<p>Harry’s heart began to beat high with
anxiety—and Rose cast furtive glances at
Mr. Gilchrist, as she went on nervously
with her work, almost resenting Martha’s
calmness. But Agnes had entered just
then from the inner room, and the kindly
greeting, which the visitor gave her, occupied
another moment, during which the
excitable Harry sat on thorns, and little
Violet, holding the last cup which she had
washed in her hands, polished it round
and round with her towel, turning solemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
wide open eyes all the time upon this
messenger of fate.</p>

<p>“I have a letter from Mr. Buchanan,”
said Mr. Gilchrist, drawing slowly from
his pocket a note written on the blue
office paper. Harry took it with eager
fingers. Agnes came to the back of his
chair, and looked over his shoulder. Rose,
trying to be very quiet, bent her head
over her work with a visible tremor, and
Martha suffered the piece of muslin she
had been working at, to fall on her
knee, and looked with grave anxiety at
Harry.</p>

<p>Round and round went the glancing
tea-cup in the snowy folds of the towel
which covered Lettie’s little hands—for she
too forgot what she was doing in curious
interest about this; a slight impatient
exclamation concluded the interval of
breathless silence. “No, I cannot take
it—it is very kind, I daresay, of Mr.
Buchanan; but I cannot accept this,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
exclaimed Harry as he handed the letter
across the table to Martha.</p>

<p>But the visitor saw, that in spite of
Harry’s quick decision, he looked at his
sister almost as if he wished her opinion
to be different. Agnes too changed her
position, and came to Martha’s side. The
letter was very short.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noin">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>My son has informed me of the
circumstances under which you have left
the office. I regret the loss for your sake,
as well as my own, but I cannot feel myself
justified in doing what I hear my son
threatened to do, consequently if you will
call at the office in the course of to-morrow,
Mr. Gilchrist has instructions to pay you
the full amount of your quarter’s salary,
due on the 1st proximo.</p>

<p class="center">
I am, Sir,<br>
Your obedient Servant,<br>
<span class="smcap">George Buchanan</span>.” 
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot take it—I do not see how I
can take it,” said Harry, irresolutely, as
he sought Martha’s eye.</p>

<p>“It’s nonsense, that,” said Mr. Gilchrist,
taking out a large silver snuff-box
and tapping slowly on its lid, with his
great forefinger, “you must look at the
thing coolly, Harry, my man. It’s no
fault of yours that you lost the money;
no sensible person would blame you for
that—a thing which has happened to
many a one before. I mind very well
being once robbed myself. I was a lad
then, about your years, and the sum was
thirty pounds; but by good fortune
twenty of it was in an English note, and
not being very sure whether it was canny
or not, I had taken its number—so off I
set to all the banks and stopped it. It
was a July day, and I was new married,
and had no superabundance of notes, let
alone twenty-pounders—such a race I
had,” said Mr. Gilchrist with a smile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
raising his red and brown handkerchief to
his brow in sympathetic recollection, “I
believe I was a stone lighter that night.
I succeeded, however, and got back my
English note very soon; but Mr. Buchanan
would not hear of deducting the other ten
from my salary; and he’s better able to
stand the loss of a few pounds now than
he was then. Think better of it, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Gilchrist is right,” said
Martha, “no one could possibly blame
you for such a misfortune, Harry—and
Mr. Buchanan is very good—you have no
right to reject his kindness; it is as ungenerous
to turn away from a favour
frankly offered, as it is to withhold more
than is meet.”</p>

<p>“It is very well said, Miss Muir,” said
Mr. Gilchrist, contemplating the long inscription
upon the heavy chased lid of his
snuff-box, with quiet satisfaction. “I
really think it would be an unkindly thing
to throw back this, which was meant for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
a kindness, into the hands that offer it.
He is not an ill man, George Buchanan;
’for one ye’ll get better, there’s waur ye’ll
get ten,’ as the song says; and besides,
Harry, I was young once myself, and so
was my wife. I mind when our James
was in his cradle like that youngster there,
we had just little enough to come and go
on; and for any pride of your own, you
must see and not scrimp your wife. Touts
man, you are not going to take ill what I
say. Do you think, if I lost a quarter’s
salary just now, it would not scrimp <i>my</i>
wife? and I think no shame of it.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I think shame—certainly
not,” said Harry, “we have only what we
work for. But I have actually lost Mr.
Buchanan’s money—I don’t see—”</p>

<p>“Harry,” interrupted Mr. Gilchrist,
“never mind telling me what you don’t
see—come down to the office to-morrow,
and hear what Mr. Buchanan sees—he has
older eyes than you, and knows the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
better, and there’s no saying what may
come of it; for you see, Mrs. Muir,” continued
the Cashier, casting down his kindly
eyes again upon the grandiloquent inscription
which testified that his snuff-box had
been presented to him by young men
trained in the office under his auspices,
as a token of esteem and respect, “it is
wonderful what a kindness everybody has
for this lad. I myself have been missing
his laugh this whole day, and scarcely
knowing what ailed me—so maybe something
better may turn up if he comes down
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And Martha thinks you should go—and
mind all that we have to do, Harry,”
whispered Agnes.</p>

<p>A glow of pleasure was on Harry’s
face—he liked to be praised, and felt in
it an innocent kindly satisfaction—but
still he hesitated. To go back again
among those who knew that he had been
dismissed and disgraced—to humiliate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
himself so far as again to recognise Dick
Buchanan as his superior—to present
himself humbly before Dick Buchanan’s
father, and propitiate his favour. It was
very unpalatable to Harry, who after his
own fashion had no lack of pride.</p>

<p>“I will see about it. I will think it
over,” said Harry doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I think I must send our Tom to you
in his red gown,” said Mr. Gilchrist;
“where he got it, I cannot say, but they
tell me the lad is a metaphysical man—if
he ever gets the length to be a preacher,
we will have to send him East, I’m thinking,
for metaphysics seldom flourish here
away; but now my wife will be redding
me up for being so late. Mind, Harry,
I will expect to see you at the office to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The good man rose to go away. “By-the-bye,”
he added as he shook hands
with Rose—and Rose felt herself look
guilty under his smiling glance. “I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
a friend of yours coming off the Ayr
coach as I came up—the advocate lad,
Mr. Buchanan’s nephew. You are sure
of his good word, Harry, or else I am
much mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Charteris!—he has come back
very soon. Good night Mr. Gilchrist, I
will think about it,” said Harry, as he
went to the door with his sister.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist left some excitement
behind him. Agnes had risen into tremulous
high spirits. Rose was touched
with some tremor of anticipation, and
Martha, watchful and jealous, looked at
her sister now and then with scrutinising
looks; for Mr. Gilchrist’s last words had
awakened Martha’s fears for another of
her children; while in the meantime little
Violet had polished all the cups and
saucers, and was now putting them with
much care away.</p>

<p>“Harry will go—do you not think he
must go, Martha?” said Agnes. “Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
Gilchrist says they miss him in the office.
I don’t wonder at that. He will go back
again, Martha?”</p>

<p>“I think he should—I think he will,”
said Martha with a slight sigh. “There
might have been something better in a
change—one has always fantastic foolish
hopes from a change—but I believe this
is best.”</p>

<p>Agnes was a little damped; for she
saw nothing but the highest good fortune
in this unlooked-for overture of Mr. Buchanan.</p>

<p>Harry lingered at the outer door in a
very different mood. He, too, had been
indulging in some indefinite hope from
change. He could not see that the former
evils lay in himself—poor Harry! He
thought if the circumstances were altered,
that happier results might follow—and
while he was not unwilling to return to
his former situation, and had even a certain
pleasure in the thought that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
open to him, the submission which it
would be necessary to make, galled him
beyond measure. He stood there at the
door, moody and uneasy; not weighing his
own feelings against the well-being of the
family, certainly, for Harry was not given
to any such process of deliberation—but
conscious that the two were antagonistic,
and moodily letting his own painful share
in the matter bulk largest in his mind.</p>

<p>Just then a hackney coach drew up
at a little distance from the door, and
Cuthbert Charteris leaped out. He was
a good deal heated, as Harry thought,
and looked as if he had taken little time
to rest, or put his dress in order since he
finished his journey—but he carried nothing
except a little paper parcel. He came
up at once to Harry and shook hands
with him cordially—they went upstairs
together.</p>

<p>“I have just come from Ayr,” said
Cuthbert with some embarrassment, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
he took his old place at the window—“you
must pardon my traveller’s costume,
Mrs. Muir, for it is not half an hour since
I arrived.”</p>

<p>“You have had little time to see the
town,” said Harry. “Did you find my
uncle? Has he sent any message with
you, Mr. Charteris?”</p>

<p>“I have a message,” said Cuthbert,
clearing his throat, and becoming flushed,
“but before I deliver it, Mr. Muir, you
must hear a long preface.”</p>

<p>“Is my uncle ill?” exclaimed Martha.
“Has anything happened?”</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened. He is quite
well,” said Cuthbert, “only I have been
making some enquiries about your family
concerns, for which I need to excuse myself
by a long story.”</p>

<p>Harry was still standing. He drew
himself up with great hauteur, and coldly
said, “Indeed!”</p>

<p>Rose lifted her head for a moment with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
timid anxiety; the light was beginning
to fail, but Rose still sat in her corner
holding the work which at present made
little progress. Martha had laid down
hers. Agnes had withdrawn to the sofa
with her baby, who, already asleep, would
very soon be disposed of in the cradle;
while Harry, with unusual stateliness,
leaned against the table, looking towards
Cuthbert.</p>

<p>“I think I mentioned before I went
away,” said Charteris, “that my errand
to Ayr was connected with one of those
stories of family pride and romance and
misfortune which sometimes lighten our
legal labours. This story you must let
me tell you, before I can explain how my
motives for searching out these, were neither
curiosity nor impertinence.”</p>

<p>As Cuthbert spoke, he opened his
parcel, placed the old Bible on the table,
and handed to Harry a little roll of papers.
They were formal extracts from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
registers of the old church at Ayr, attested
by the session clerk, proving the marriage
of Rose Allenders with John Calder, and
of Violet Calder with James Muir, together
with the register of Harry’s own
birth.</p>

<p>Harry was quite bewildered; he turned
over the papers, half curious, half angry,
and tried to look cool and haughty; but
wonder and interest defeated his pride,
and impatiently calling for the candle,
which Violet, with much care, was just
then bringing into the room, Harry threw
himself into the arm chair, and resting
his elbows on the table, leaned his head
upon both his hands, and fixed his eyes,
with a half defiance in them, full upon
Cuthbert.</p>

<p>The others drew near the light with interest
and curiosity as great as his; but
though they held their breath while they
listened, they did not restrain their fingers—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
necessity of work was too great
to be conquered by a passing wonder.</p>

<p>“Not much short of a century since,”
said Cuthbert, becoming excited in spite
of himself, “a family in the neighbourhood
of Stirling had their composure disturbed
by what seemed to them the very
foolish marriage of one of their sons.
There were six sons in the family: this
one was the fourth, and at that time had
very little visible prospect of ever being
heir. They were but small gentry, and I
do not very well know why they were so
jealous of their gentility; but however
that might be, this marriage was followed
by effects as tragic as if the offender had
been a prince’s son instead of a country
laird’s.</p>

<p>His father disinherited and disowned
him; he was cut off from all intercourse
with his family; but in his own affairs he
seems to have been prosperous enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
until his wife died. That event closed
the brighter side of life for this melancholy
man. He had two daughters, then children,
and with them he left Stirling.”</p>

<p>A slight start moved the somewhat stiff
figure of Martha; Rose unconsciously let
her work fall and turned her head towards
Cuthbert; Harry remained in the same
position, fixedly gazing at him; while
Agnes, rocking the cradle gently with her
foot, looked on a little amused, a little interested,
and not a little curious, wondering
what the story could mean.</p>

<p>“After this,” continued Cuthbert, “my
hero, we suppose went to London (another
strange start as if of one half asleep, testified
some recognition, on Martha’s part, of the
story), but there I lose trace of him. It
is only for a short time, however, for immediately
afterwards I find him at Ayr.”</p>

<p>“At Ayr?” Harry too, started now,
and again turned over the papers, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
he still held in his hand, as if looking for
a clue.</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” said Cuthbert,
“all the other members of the family are
dead; there is no one remaining of the
blood but this man—the children of this
man.”</p>

<p>“And his name?” said Martha, with a
slight hoarseness in her voice.</p>

<p>“His name,” said Cuthbert, drawing a
long breath of relief, as his story ended,
“was John Allenders.”</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence. They
looked at each other with bewildered faces.
“What does it mean?” said Harry, becoming
very red and hot as the papers
fell from his shaking fingers; “I cannot
see—it is so great a surprise—tell us what
it means.”</p>

<p>“It means,” said Cuthbert, quickly,
“that you are the heir of John Allenders
of Allenders, and of an estate which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
been in the family for centuries, worth
more than four hundred pounds a year.”</p>

<p>Harry looked round for a moment almost
unmeaningly—he was stupified; but
Agnes stole, as she always did in every
emergency, to the back of his chair, and
laid her hand softly on his shoulder. It
seemed to awake him as from a dream.
With one hand he grasped hers, with the
other he snatched the work from Martha’s
fingers and tossed it to the other end of
the room. “Agnes! Martha!”</p>

<p>Poor Harry! A sob came between the
two names, and his eyes were swimming in
sudden tears. He did not know what to
say in the joyful shock of this unlooked-for
fortune; he could only grasp their
hands and repeat their names again.</p>

<p>Cuthbert rose to withdraw, feeling himself
a restraint on their joy, but Martha
disengaged herself from the grasp of
Harry, and would not suffer him to move.</p>
<p>“No, no; share with us the pleasure you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
bring. You have seen us in trouble, stay
with us now.”</p>

<p>“Is it true, Mr. Charteris, is it true?”
said Agnes, while Harry, still perfectly
tremulous and unsteady, threw Rose’s
work after Martha’s, and shaded his eyes
with his hands, lest they should see how
near weeping he was—“Tell us if it is
true.”</p>

<p>Harry started to his feet. “True! do
you think he would tell us anything that
was not true? Mr. Charteris, if they
were not all better than me, I would
think it was a delusion—that neither such
an inheritance nor such a friend could
come to my lot. But it’s for them—it’s
for them! and a new beginning, a new
life—Martha, we shall not be worsted
this time—it is God has sent us this other
battle-field.”</p>

<p>And Harry, with irrestrainable emotion,
lifted up his voice and wept. His little
wife clung to his shoulder, his stern sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
bent over him with such an unspeakable
tenderness and yearning hope in her
face, that it became glorified with sudden
beauty—and Cuthbert remembered
uncle Sandy’s thanksgiving, and himself
could have wept in sympathy for the
solemn trembling of this joy; for not the
sudden wealth and ease, but the prospect
of a new life it was which called forth
those tears.</p>

<p>“And what did my uncle say, Mr.
Charteris,” said Rose, when the tumult
had in some degree subsided. No one
but Rose remembered that Cuthbert had
spoken of a message from uncle Sandy.</p>

<p>“He bade me repeat to you a homely
proverb,” said Cuthbert, who was quite as
unsteady as the rest, and had been a good
deal at a loss how to get rid of some
strange drops which moistened his eyelashes.
“It takes a strong hand to hold
a full cup steady; that is the philosophy
I brought from your uncle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>

<p>“No fear,” said Harry, looking up once
more with the bright clear loveable face,
which no one could frown upon. “No
fear—what could I do with my arms
bound? What could I do in yon office?
but now, Martha, now!”</p>

<p>And Martha once more believed and
hoped, ascending out of the depths of her
dreary quietness into a very heaven. Few
have ever felt, and few could understand
this glorious revulsion. With an impatient
bound she sprang out of the abyss, and
scorned it with her buoyant foot. It might
not last—perhaps it could not last—but
one hour of such exulting certain hope,
almost worth a lifetime’s trial.</p>

<p>“And I will get a little room all to
mysel, and Katie Calder will come and
sleep with me,” said Violet.</p>

<p>They all laughed unsteadily. It brought
them down to an easier level.</p>

<p>“I think, Mr. Muir you should come
at once with me to Edinburgh,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
Cuthbert, “and see your lawyer, who has
been hunting for you for some time, and
get the proof and your claim established.
I begin to think it was very fortunate he
broke his leg, Miss Muir—for otherwise I
might never have seen you.”</p>

<p>“And what made you think of us? how
did you guess?” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Rose and Violet,” said Cuthbert, with
a little shyness. “It was a happy chance
which gave these names.”</p>

<p>Rose drew back a little. There was
something unusual, it seemed, in Cuthbert’s
pronunciation of her pretty name,
for it made her blush; and by a strange
sympathy Mr. Charteris blushed too.</p>

<p>“When shall we start? for I suppose
you will go with me to Edinburgh,” continued
Charteris.</p>

<p>Harry hesitated a moment. “I must
go down to the office to-morrow,” he said,
with his joyous face unclouded. “Your
cousin Dick and I had something which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
thought a quarrel. It was nothing but a
few angry words after all. I will go down
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Harry had entirely forgotten how angry
he was—entirely forgotten the insulting
things Dick Buchanan said, and what a
humiliation he had felt it would be, to
enter that office again. Poor Harry was
humble now. He had such a happy ease
of forgetting, that he did not feel it necessary
to forgive. Bright, sanguine, overflowing
with generous emotions, Harry in
his new wealth and happiness that night
could not remember that there was any
one in the world other than a friend.</p>
